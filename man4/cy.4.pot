"Correct programs talking to correctly wired external devices work with "
"almost arbitrary initial states and almost no locking, but other setups may "
"benefit from changing some of the default initial state and locking the "
"state.  In particular, the initial states for non (POSIX) standard flags "
"should be set to suit the devices attached and may need to be locked to "
"prevent buggy programs from changing them.  E.g., CRTSCTS should be locked "
"on for devices that support RTS/CTS handshaking at all times and off for "
"devices that do not support it at all.  CLOCAL should be locked on for "
"devices that do not support carrier.  HUPCL may be locked off if you do not "
"want to hang up for some reason.  In general, very bad things happen if "
"something is locked to the wrong state, and things should not be locked for "
"devices that support more than one setting.  The CLOCAL flag on callin ports "
"should be locked off for logins to avoid certain security holes, but this "
