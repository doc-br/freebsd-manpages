"The E<.Xr ntpd 8> daemon has been the dominant solution for system clock "
"synchronisation for many years, which has in turn influenced the design of "
"the system clock.  The ntpd daemon implements a feedback control algorithm "
"which has been demonstrated to perform poorly in common use cases."

"Feed-forward clock synchronisation algorithms implemented by an appropriate "
"daemon, in concert with the E<.Nm> kernel support, have been shown to "
"provide highly robust and accurate clock synchronisation.  In addition to "
"time keeping, the E<.Nm> kernel mechanism provides new timestamping "
"capabilities and the ability to use specialised clocks.  Feed-forward "
"synchronisation is also very well suited for virtualised environments, "
"reducing the overhead of timekeeping in guests and ensuring continued smooth "
"operation of the system clock during guest live migration."
