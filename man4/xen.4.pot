msgid ""
"The Xen Hypervisor allows multiple virtual machines to be run on a single "
"computer system.  When first released, Xen required that i386 kernels be "
"compiled \"para-virtualized\" as the x86 instruction set was not fully "
"virtualizable.  Primarily, para-virtualization modifies the virtual memory "
"system to use hypervisor calls (hypercalls) rather than direct hardware "
"instructions to modify the TLB, although para-virtualized device drivers "
"were also required to access resources such as virtual network interfaces "
"and disk devices."

"With later instruction set extensions from AMD and Intel to support fully "
"virtualizable instructions, unmodified virtual memory systems can also be "
"supported; this is referred to as hardware-assisted virtualization (HVM).  "
"HVM configurations may either rely on transparently emulated hardware "
"peripherals, or para-virtualized drivers, which are aware of virtualization, "
"and hence able to optimize certain behaviors to improve performance or "
"semantics."
