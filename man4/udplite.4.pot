"The E<.Tn UDP-Lite> protocol provides a partial checksum which allows "
"corrupted packets to be transmitted to the receiving application.  This has "
"advantages for some types of multimedia transport that may be able to make "
"use of slightly damaged datagrams, rather than having them discarded by "
"lower-layer protocols."
