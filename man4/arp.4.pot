"The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to dynamically map between "
"Protocol Addresses (such as IP addresses) and Local Network Addresses (such "
"as Ethernet addresses).  This implementation maps IP addresses to Ethernet, "
"ARCnet, or Token Ring addresses.  It is used by all the Ethernet interface "
"drivers."

"ARP caches Internet-Ethernet address mappings.  When an interface requests a "
"mapping for an address not in the cache, ARP queues the message which "
"requires the mapping and broadcasts a message on the associated network "
"requesting the address mapping.  If a response is provided, the new mapping "
"is cached and any pending message is transmitted.  ARP will queue at most "
"one packet while waiting for a response to a mapping request; only the most "
"recently ``transmitted'' packet is kept.  If the target host does not "
"respond after several requests, the host is considered to be down allowing "
"an error to be returned to transmission attempts.  Further demand for this "
"mapping causes ARP request retransmissions, that are ratelimited to one "
"packet per second.  The error is E<.Er EHOSTDOWN> for a non-responding "
"destination host, and E<.Er EHOSTUNREACH> for a non-responding router."

"The ARP cache is stored in the system routing table as dynamically-created "
"host routes.  The route to a directly-attached Ethernet network is installed "
"as a E<.Dq cloning> route (one with the E<.Li RTF_CLONING> flag set), "
"causing routes to individual hosts on that network to be created on demand.  "
"These routes time out periodically (normally 20 minutes after validated; "
"entries are not validated when not in use)."

"Proxy ARP is a feature whereby the local host will respond to requests for "

"adding an entry for each host inside a given subnet for which proxying of "
"ARP requests is desired.  However, the E<.Dq \"proxy all\"> feature causes "
"the local host to act as a proxy for E<.Em all> hosts reachable through some "
"other network interface, different from the one the request came in from.  "
"It may be enabled by setting the E<.Xr sysctl 8> MIB variable E<.Va "
