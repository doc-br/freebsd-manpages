"The E<.Nm> network layer implements the state machine and the Link Control "
"Protocol (LCP) of the E<.Em point to point protocol (PPP)> as described in "
"RFC 1661.  Note that this layer does not provide network interfaces of its "
"own, it is rather intended to be layered on top of drivers providing a "
"synchronous point-to-point connection that wish to run a PPP stack over it.  "
"The corresponding network interfaces have to be provided by these hardware "
"drivers."

"The E<.Nm> layer provides three basic modes of operation.  The default mode, "
"with no special flags to be set, is to create the PPP connection "
"(administrative E<.Em Open> event to the LCP layer) as soon as the interface "
"is taken up with the E<.Xr ifconfig 8> command.  Taking the interface down "
"again will terminate the LCP layer and thus all other layers on top.  The "
"link will also terminate itself as soon as no Network Control Protocol (NCP) "
"is open anymore, indicating that the lower layers are no longer needed."

"Setting the link-level flag E<.Em link0> with E<.Xr ifconfig 8> will cause "
"the respective network interface to go into E<.Em passive> mode.  This "
"means, the administrative E<.Em Open> event to the LCP layer will be delayed "
"until after the lower layers signals an E<.Em Up> event (rise of E<.Dq "
"carrier>).  This can be used by lower layers to support a dialin connection "
"where the physical layer is not available immediately at startup, but only "
"after some external event arrives.  Receipt of a E<.Em Down> event from the "
"lower layer will not take the interface completely down in this case."

"Finally, setting the flag E<.Em link1> will cause the interface to operate "
"in E<.Em dial-on-demand> mode.  This is also only useful if the lower layer "
"supports the notion of a carrier.  Upon configuring the respective "
"interface, it will delay the administrative E<.Em Open> event to the LCP "
"layer until either an outbound network packet arrives, or until the lower "
"layer signals an E<.Em Up> event, indicating an inbound connection.  As with "
"passive mode, receipt of a E<.Em Down> event (loss of carrier) will not "
"automatically take the interface down, thus it remains available for further "
"connections."

"The E<.Nm> layer supports the E<.Em debug> interface flag that can be set "
"with E<.Xr ifconfig 8>.  If this flag is set, the various control protocol "
"packets being exchanged as well as the option negotiation between both ends "
"of the link will be logged at level E<.Dv LOG_DEBUG>.  This can be helpful "
"to examine configuration problems during the first attempts to set up a new "
"configuration.  Without this flag being set, only the major phase "
"transitions will be logged at level E<.Dv LOG_INFO>."

"It is possible to leave the local interface IP address open for negotiation "
"by setting it to 0.0.0.0.  This requires that the remote peer can correctly "
"supply a value for it based on the identity of the caller, or on the remote "
"address supplied by this side.  Due to the way the IPCP option negotiation "
"works, this address is being supplied late during the negotiation, which "
"might cause the remote peer to make wrong assumptions."
