"The E<.Nm> driver provides the back half of a paravirtualized E<.Xr xen 4> "
"network connection.  The netback and netfront drivers appear to their "
"respective operating systems as Ethernet devices linked by a crossover "
"cable.  Typically, E<.Nm> will run on Domain 0 and the netfront driver will "
"run on a guest domain.  However, it is also possible to run E<.Nm> on a "
"guest domain.  It may be bridged or routed to provide the netfront domain "
"access to other guest domains or to a physical network."

"Packets sent through Xennet pass over shared memory, so the protocol "
"includes no form of link-layer checksum or CRC.  Furthermore, Xennet drivers "
"always report to their hosts that they support receive and transmit checksum "
"offloading.  They \"offload\" the checksum calculation by simply skipping "
"it.  That works fine for packets that are exchanged between two domains on "
"the same machine.  However, when a Xennet interface is bridged to a physical "
"interface, a correct checksum must be attached to any packets bound for that "
"physical interface.  Currently, E<.Fx> lacks any mechanism for an Ethernet "
"device to inform the OS that newly received packets are valid even though "
"their checksums are not.  So if the netfront driver is configured to offload "
"checksum calculations, it will pass non-checksumed packets to E<.Nm>, which "
"must then calculate the checksum in software before passing the packet to "
"the OS."

"For this reason, it is recommended that if E<.Nm> is bridged to a physical "
"interface, then transmit checksum offloading should be disabled on the "
"netfront.  The Xennet protocol does not have any mechanism for the netback "
"to request the netfront to do this; the operator must do it manually."
