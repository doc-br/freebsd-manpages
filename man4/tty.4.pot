"Each hardware terminal port on the system usually has a terminal special "
"device file associated with it in the directory ``/dev/'' (for example, "
"``/dev/tty03'').  When a user logs into the system on one of these hardware "
"terminal ports, the system has already opened the associated device and "
"prepared the line for normal interactive use (see E<.Xr getty 8>.)  There is "
"also a special case of a terminal file that connects not to a hardware "
"terminal port, but to another program on the other side.  These special "
"terminal devices are called E<.Em ptys> and provide the mechanism necessary "
"to give users the same interface to the system when logging in over a "
"network (using E<.Xr rlogin 1>, or E<.Xr telnet 1> for example).  Even in "
"these cases the details of how the terminal file was opened and set up is "
"already handled by special software in the system.  Thus, users do not "
"normally need to worry about the details of how these lines are opened or "
"used.  Also, these lines are often used for dialing out of a system (through "
"an out-calling modem), but again the system provides programs that hide the "
"details of accessing these terminal special files (see E<.Xr tip 1>)."
