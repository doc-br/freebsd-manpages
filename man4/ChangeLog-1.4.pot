" o If the kernel tells us that there are a negative number of bytes to read "
"from a socket, do not believe it.  Fixes bug 2841177; found by Alexander "
"Pronchenkov.\n"
" o Do not allocate the maximum event queue and fd array for the epoll "
"backend at startup.  Instead, start out accepting 32 events at a time, and "
"double the queue's size when it seems that the OS is generating events "
"faster than we're requesting them.  Saves up to 512K per epoll-based "
"event_base.  Resolves bug 2839240.\n"
" o Fix compilation on Android, which forgot to define fd_mask in its "
"sys/select.h\n"

"Masiulaniec\n"

"code.\n"
" o Use __VA_ARGS__ syntax for varargs macros in event_rpcgen when compiler "

"Kerr\n"
" o better documentation for event_base_loopexit; from Scott Lamb.\n"

"ignore such signals.\n"

" o New function, event_{base_}loopbreak.  Like event_loopexit, it makes an "
"event loop stop executing and return.  Unlike event_loopexit, it keeps "
"subsequent pending events from getting executed.  Patch from Scott Lamb\n"
" o Removed obsoleted recalc code\n"
" o pull setters/getters out of RPC structures into a base class to which we "

" o support for 32-bit tag numbers in rpc structures; this is wire "
"compatible, but changes the API slightly.\n"
" o prefix {encode,decode}_tag functions with evtag to avoid collisions\n"
" o Correctly handle DNS replies with no answers set (Fixes bug 1846282)\n"
" o The configure script now takes an --enable-gcc-warnigns option that turns "
"on many optional gcc warnings.  (Nick has been building with these for a "
"while, but they might be useful to other developers.)\n"
" o When building with GCC, use the \"format\" attribute to verify type "
"correctness of calls to printf-like functions.\n"
" o removed linger from http server socket; reported by Ilya Martynov\n"
" o allow \\r or \\n individually to separate HTTP headers instead of the "
"standard \"\\r\\n\"; from Charles Kerr.\n"
" o demote most http warnings to debug messages\n"
" o Fix Solaris compilation; from Magne Mahre\n"
" o Add a \"Date\" header to HTTP responses, as required by HTTP 1.1.\n"
" o Support specifying the local address of an evhttp_connection using "
"set_local_address\n"
" o Fix a memory leak in which failed HTTP connections would not free the "
"request object\n"

"memory allocation\n"
" o Fix a memory leak in the DNS server\n"
" o Fix compilation when DNS_USE_OPENSSL_FOR_ID is enabled\n"
" o Fix buffer size and string generation in evdns_resolve_reverse_ipv6().\n"
" o Respond to nonstandard DNS queries with \"NOTIMPL\" rather than by "
"ignoring them.\n"
" o In DNS responses, the CD flag should be preserved, not the TC flag.\n"
" o Fix http.c to compile properly with USE_DEBUG; from Christopher Layne\n"
" o Handle NULL timeouts correctly on Solaris; from Trond Norbye\n"
" o Recalculate pending events properly when reallocating event array on "
"Solaris; from Trond Norbye\n"

"   transaction ID generation code.\n"
" o Add an evutil module (with header evutil.h) to implement our standard "
"cross-platform hacks, on the theory that somebody else would like to use "
"them too.\n"
" o Fix signals implementation on windows.\n"
" o Fix http module on windows to close sockets properly.\n"
" o Make autogen.sh script run correctly on systems where /bin/sh isn't "
"bash. (Patch from Trond Norbye, rewritten by Hagne Mahre and then Hannah "
"Schroeter.)\n"
" o Skip calling gettime() in timeout_process if we are not in fact waiting "
"for any events. (Patch from Trond Norbye)\n"
" o Make test subdirectory compile under mingw.\n"
" o Fix win32 buffer.c behavior so that it is correct for sockets (which do "
"not like ReadFile and WriteFile).\n"
" o Make the test.sh script run unit tests for the evpoll method.\n"
" o Make the entire evdns.h header enclosed in \"extern C\" as appropriate.\n"
" o Fix implementation of strsep on platforms that lack it\n"
" o Fix implementation of getaddrinfo on platforms that lack it; mainly, this "
"will make Windows http.c work better.  Original patch by Lubomir Marinov.\n"
" o Fix evport implementation: port_disassociate called on unassociated "
"events resulting in bogus errors; more efficient memory management; from "
"Trond Norbye and Prakash Sangappa\n"
" o support for hooks on rpc input and output; can be used to implement rpc "
"independent processing such as compression or authentication.\n"
" o use a min heap instead of a red-black tree for timeouts; as a result "
"finding the min is a O(1) operation now; from Maxim Yegorushkin\n"
" o associate an event base with an rpc pool\n"
" o added two additional libraries: libevent_core and libevent_extra in "
"addition to the regular libevent.  libevent_core contains only the event "
"core whereas libevent_extra contains dns, http and rpc support\n"
" o Begin using libtool's library versioning support correctly.  If we don't "
"mess up, this will more or less guarantee binaries linked against old "
"versions of libevent continue working when we make changes to libevent that "
"do not break backward compatibility.\n"
" o Fix evhttp.h compilation when TAILQ_ENTRY is not defined.\n"
" o Small code cleanups in epoll_dispatch().\n"
" o Increase the maximum number of addresses read from a packet in evdns to "
"32.\n"
" o Remove support for the rtsig method: it hasn't compiled for a while, and "
"nobody seems to miss it very much.  Let us know if there's a good reason to "
"put it back in.\n"
" o Rename the \"class\" field in evdns_server_request to dns_question_class, "
"so that it won't break compilation under C++.  Use a macro so that old code "
"won't break.  Mark the macro as deprecated.\n"
" o Fix DNS unit tests so that having a DNS server with broken IPv6 support "
"is no longer cause for aborting the unit tests.\n"
" o Make event_base_free() succeed even if there are pending non-internal "
"events on a base.  This may still leak memory and fds, but at least it no "
"longer crashes.\n"
" o Post-process the config.h file into a new, installed event-config.h file "
"that we can install, and whose macros will be safe to include in header "
"files.\n"
" o Remove the long-deprecated acconfig.h file.\n"
" o Do not require #include E<lt>sys/types.hE<gt> before #include "
"E<lt>event.hE<gt>.\n"
" o Add new evutil_timer* functions to wrap (or replace) the regular timeval "
"manipulation functions.\n"
" o Fix many build issues when using the Microsoft C compiler.\n"
" o Remove a bash-ism in autogen.sh\n"
" o When calling event_del on a signal, restore the signal handler's previous "
"value rather than setting it to SIG_DFL. Patch from Christopher Layne.\n"
" o Make the logic for active events work better with internal events; patch "
"from Christopher Layne.\n"
" o We do not need to specially remove a timeout before calling event_del; "
"patch from Christopher Layne.\n"
