"Divert sockets are similar to raw IP sockets, except that they can be bound "
"to a specific E<.Nm> port via the E<.Xr bind 2> system call.  The IP address "
"in the bind is ignored; only the port number is significant.  A divert "
"socket bound to a divert port will receive all packets diverted to that port "
"by some (here unspecified) kernel mechanism(s).  Packets may also be written "
"to a divert port, in which case they re-enter kernel IP packet processing."

"Divert sockets are normally used in conjunction with E<.Fx Ns 's> packet "

"writing to a divert socket, matching packets can be passed through an "

"routing tricks can be done, etc."
