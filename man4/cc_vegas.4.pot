"The time from the transmission of a marked packet until the receipt of an "
"acknowledgement for that packet is measured once per RTT.  This "
"implementation does not implement Brakmo's and Peterson's original duplicate "
"ACK policy since clock ticks in today's machines are not as coarse as they "
"were (i.e. 500ms) when Vegas was originally designed.  Note that modern TCP "
"recovery processes such as fast retransmit and SACK are enabled by default "
"in the TCP stack."
