"The E<.Nm> driver provides support for the Non-Transparent Bridge (NTB) "
"hardware in PLX PCIe bridge chips, which allow up to two of their PCIe ports "
"to be switched from transparent to non-transparent bridge mode.  In this "
"mode bridge looks not as a PCI bridge, but as PCI endpoint device.  The "
"driver hides hardware details, exposing memory windows, scratchpads and "
"doorbells of the other side via hardware independent KPI to E<.Xr ntb 4> "
"subsystem."

"Each PLX NTB provides up to 2 64-bit or 4 32-bit memory windows to the other "
"system's memory, 6 or 12 scratchpad registers and 16 doorbells to interrupt "
"the other system.  In NTB-to-NTB mode one of memory windows (or half of it, "
"if bigger then 1MB)  is consumed by the driver itself to access scratchpad "
"and doorbell registers of the other side."
