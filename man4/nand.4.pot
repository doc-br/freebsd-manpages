"The E<.Fx> E<.Nm> framework consists of a set of interfaces that aim to "
"provide an extensible, object oriented environment for NAND controllers and "
"NAND Flash memory chips from various hardware vendors, and to allow for "
"uniform and flexible management of the NAND devices.  It comprises of the "
"following major components:"

"This layer implements basic functionality of a NAND Flash controller.  It "
