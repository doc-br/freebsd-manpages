"The E<.Nm loop> interface is a software loopback mechanism which may be used "
"for performance analysis, software testing, and/or local communication.  As "
"with other network interfaces, the loopback interface must have network "
"addresses assigned for each address family with which it is to be used.  "
"These addresses may be set with the appropriate E<.Xr ioctl 2> commands for "
"corresponding address families.  The loopback interface should be the last "
"interface configured, as protocols may use the order of configuration as an "
"indication of priority.  The loopback should E<.Em never> be configured "
"first unless no hardware interfaces exist."

"By default, both receive and transmit checksum flags will be enabled, in "

"data corruption is unlikely.  If transmit checksum generation is disabled, "
"then validation should also be disabled in order to avoid packets being "
"dropped due to invalid checksums."
