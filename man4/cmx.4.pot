"The E<.Nm> driver provides support for the PCCARD based E<.Em Omnikey "
"CardMan 4040> smartcard reader.  The driver provides a character device "
"special file based E<.Em Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices (CCID)> "
"interface.  The driver implements what the vendor calls the E<.Em "
"Synchronous API> onto the smartcard reader device."

"Reading and writing is synchronous, meaning that a call to E<.Xr write 2> "
"directly corresponds to a complete CCID command sent to the device, while "
"the following E<.Xr read 2> will return the complete answer from the "
"reader.  There is no support for partial reads or writes.  There is no upper "
"limit on CCID request or response sizes, but the complete CCID request must "
"be sent to the driver in E<.Xr write 2> and the complete CCID response must "
"fit into the buffer supplied to E<.Xr read 2>."
