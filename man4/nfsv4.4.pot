"The NFS client and server provides support for the E<.Tn NFSv4> "
"specification; see E<.%T \"Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol RFC "
"7530\" and> E<.%T \"Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 "
"Protocol RFC 5661\">.  The protocol is somewhat similar to NFS Version 3, "
"but differs in significant ways.  It uses a single compound RPC that "
"concatenates operations to-gether.  Each of these operations are similar to "
"the RPCs of NFS Version 3.  The operations in the compound are performed in "
"order, until one of them fails (returns an error) and then the RPC "
"terminates at that point."

"It has integrated locking support, which implies that the server is no "
"longer stateless.  As such, the E<.Nm> server remains in recovery mode for a "
"grace period (always greater than the lease duration the server uses) after "
"a reboot.  During this grace period, clients may recover state but not "
"perform other open/lock state changing operations.  To provide for correct "
"recovery semantics, a small file described by E<.Xr stablerestart 5> is used "
"by the server during the recovery phase.  If this file is missing or empty, "
"there is a backup copy maintained by E<.Xr nfsd 8> that will be used. If "
"either file is missing, they will be created by the E<.Xr nfsd 8>.  If both "
"the file and the backup copy are empty, it will result in the server "
"starting without providing a grace period for recovery.  Note that recovery "
"only occurs when the server machine is rebooted, not when the E<.Xr nfsd 8> "
"are just restarted."
