"Security Event Audit is a facility to provide fine-grained, configurable "
"logging of security-relevant events, and is intended to meet the "
"requirements of the Common Criteria (CC) Common Access Protection Profile "
"(CAPP)  evaluation.  The E<.Fx> E<.Nm> facility implements the de facto "
"industry standard BSM API, file formats, and command line interface, first "
"found in the Solaris operating system.  Information on the user space "
"implementation can be found in E<.Xr libbsm 3>."
