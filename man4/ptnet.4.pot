"The E<.Nm> device driver provides direct access to host netmap ports, from "
"within a Virtual Machine (VM).  Applications running inside the VM can "
"access the TX/RX rings and buffers of a netmap port that the hypervisor has "
"passed-through to the VM.  Hypervisor support for E<.Nm> is currently "
"available for QEMU/KVM.  Any E<.Xr netmap 4> port can be passed-through, "
"including physical NICs, E<.Xr vale 4> ports, netmap pipes, etc."

"The main use-case for netmap passthrough is Network Function Virtualization "
"(NFV), where middlebox applications running within VMs may want to process "
"very high packet rates (e.g., 1-10 millions packets per second or more).  "
"Note, however, that those applications must use the device in netmap mode in "
"order to achieve such rates.  In addition to the general advantages of "
"netmap, the improved performance of E<.Nm> when compared to hypervisor "
"device emulation or paravirtualization (e.g., E<.Xr vtnet 4>, E<.Xr vmx 4>)  "
"comes from the hypervisor being completely bypassed in the data-path.  For "
"example, when using E<.Xr vtnet 4> the VM has to convert each E<.Xr mbuf 9> "
"to a VirtIO-specific packet representation and publish that to a VirtIO "
"queue; on the hypervisor side, the packet is extracted from the VirtIO queue "
"and converted to a hypervisor-specific packet representation.  The overhead "
"of format conversions (and packet copies, in same cases) is not incured by "
"E<.Nm> in netmap mode, because mbufs are not used at all, and the packet "
"format is the one defined by netmap (e.g., E<.Ar struct netmap_slot>)  along "
"the whole data-path.  No format conversions or copies happen."

"It is also possible to use a E<.Nm> device like a regular network interface, "
"which interacts with the E<.Fx> network stack (i.e., not in netmap mode).  "
"However, in that case it is necessary to pay the cost of data copies between "
"mbufs and netmap buffers, which generally results in lower TCP/UDP "
"performance than E<.Xr vtnet 4> or other paravirtualized network devices.  "
"If the passed-through netmap port supports the VirtIO network header, E<.Nm> "
"is able to use it, and support TCP/UDP checksum offload (for both transmit "
"and receive), TCP segmentation offload (TSO) and TCP large receive offload "
"(LRO).  Currently, E<.Xr vale 4> ports support the header.  Note that the "
"VirtIO network header is generally not used in NFV use-cases, because "
"middleboxes are not endpoints of TCP/UDP connections."
