"The E<.Nm> driver is a wrapper designed to allow binary E<.Tn Windows\\[rg]> "
"NDIS miniport network drivers to be used with E<.Fx>.  The E<.Nm> driver is "
"provided in source code form and must be combined with the E<.Tn "
"Windows\\[rg]> driver supplied with your network adapter.  The E<.Nm> driver "
"uses the E<.Nm ndisapi> kernel subsystem to relocate and link the E<.Tn "
"Windows\\[rg]> binary so that it can be used in conjunction with native "
"code.  The E<.Nm ndisapi> subsystem provides an interface between the NDIS "
"API and the E<.Fx> networking infrastructure.  The E<.Tn Windows\\[rg]> "
"driver is essentially fooled into thinking it is running on E<.Tn "
"Windows\\[rg]>.  Note that this means the E<.Nm> driver is only useful on "
"x86 machines."

"To build a functional driver, the user must have a copy of the driver "
"distribution media for his or her card.  From this distribution, the user "
"must extract two files: the E<.Pa .SYS> file containing the driver binary "
"code, and its companion E<.Pa .INF> file, which contains the definitions for "
"driver-specific registry keys and other installation data such as device "
"identifiers.  These two files can be converted into a kernel module file "
"using the E<.Xr ndisgen 8> utility.  This file contains a binary image of "
"the driver plus registry key data.  When the E<.Nm> driver loads, it will "
"create E<.Xr sysctl 3> nodes for each registry key extracted from the E<.Pa "
".INF> file."

"The E<.Nm> driver is designed to support mainly Ethernet and wireless "
"network devices with PCI, PCMCIA and USB bus attachments.  (Cardbus devices "
"are also supported as a subset of PCI.)  It can support many different media "
"types and speeds.  One limitation however, is that there is no consistent "
"way to learn if an Ethernet device is operating in full or half duplex "
"mode.  The NDIS API allows for a generic means for determining link state "
"and speed, but not the duplex setting.  There may be driver-specific "
"registry keys to control the media setting which can be configured via the "
"E<.Xr sysctl 8> command."
