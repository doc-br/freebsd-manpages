msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> driver provides support for direct access devices, implementing "
"the E<.Tn ATA> command protocol, that are attached to the system through a "
"host adapter supported by the CAM subsystem."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"The host adapter must also be separately configured into the system before "
"an E<.Tn ATA> direct access device can be configured."

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/ada.4:63
msgid ""
"Command queuing allows the device to process multiple transactions "
"concurrently, often re-ordering them to reduce the number and length of "
"seeks.  E<.Tn ATA> defines two types of queuing: E<.Tn TCQ (Tagged Command "
"Queuing, PATA legacy)> and E<.Tn NCQ (Native Command Queuing, SATA)>.  The "
"E<.Nm> device driver takes full advantage of NCQ, when supported.  To ensure "
"that transactions to distant parts of the media, which may be deferred "
"indefinitely by servicing requests closer to the current head position, are "
"completed in a timely fashion, an ordered transaction is sent every 7 "
"seconds during continuous device operation."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/ada.4:69
msgid ""
"Many direct access devices are equipped with read and/or write caches.  "
"Parameters affecting the device's cache are reported in device IDENTIFY data "
"and can be examined and modified via the E<.Xr camcontrol 8> utility."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/ada.4:76
msgid ""
"The read cache is used to store data from device-initiated read ahead "
"operations as well as frequently used data.  The read cache is transparent "
"to the user and can be enabled without any adverse effect.  Most devices "
"with a read cache come from the factory with it enabled."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/ada.4:97
msgid ""
"The write cache can greatly decrease the latency of write operations and "
"allows the device to reorganize writes to increase efficiency and "
"performance.  This performance gain comes at a price.  Should the device "
"lose power while its cache contains uncommitted write operations, these "
"writes will be lost.  The effect of a loss of write transactions on a file "
"system is non-deterministic and can cause corruption.  Most devices age "
"write transactions to limit the vulnerability to a few transactions recently "
"reported as complete, but it is nonetheless recommended that systems with "
"write cache enabled devices reside on an Uninterruptible Power Supply "
"(UPS).  The E<.Nm> device driver ensures that the cache and media are "
"synchronized upon final close of the device or an unexpected shutdown "
"(panic) event.  This ensures that it is safe to disconnect power once the "
"operating system has reported that it has halted."
