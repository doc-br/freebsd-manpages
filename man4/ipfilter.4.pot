"IP Filter is a TCP/IP packet filter, suitable for use in a firewall "
"environment. To use, it can either be used as a loadable kernel module or "
"incorporated into your UNIX kernel; use as a loadable kernel module where "
"possible is highly recommended. Scripts are provided to install and patch "
