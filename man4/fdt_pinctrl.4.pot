"Pin multiplexing is a technology used to re-purpose a single physical "
"connection (depending on chip packaging it may be pin, ball, or pad) by "
"routing its signal to any one of several different SoC internal devices.  "
"For example, based on the actual device design, a single SoC chip pin might "
"perform any of these roles: SPI clock, I2C data, GPIO pin, or PWM signal.  "
"Function selection is performed by the pinmux controller, a SoC hardware "
"block which is usually controlled by a set of registers.  Pinmux controller "
"capabilities and register format depend on the actual hardware "
"implementation."

"On E<.Xr fdt 4> based systems, the pinmux controller is represented by a "

"Client devices are hardware devices that require certain pin configurations "
"to function properly.  Depending on the state the device is in (active, "
"idle) it might require different pin configurations.  Each configuration is "
"described by setting the pinctrl-N property to the list of phandles pointing "
"to specific child nodes of the pinmux controller node.  N is an integer "
"value starting with 0 and incremented by 1 for every new set of pin "
"configurations.  pinctrl-0 is a default configuration that is applied in the "
"E<.Xr fdt_pinctrl_configure_tree 9> call.  In addition to referring to pin "
"configurations by index, they can be referred to by name if the "
"pinctrl-names property is set.  The value of pinctrl-names is a list of "
"strings with names for each pinctrl-N property.  Client devices can request "
"specific configuration using E<.Xr fdt_pinctrl_configure 9> and E<.Xr "
"fdt_pinctrl_configure_by_name 9>."
