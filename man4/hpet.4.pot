msgid ""
"This driver uses High Precision Event Timer hardware (part of the chipset, "
"usually enumerated via ACPI) to supply kernel with one time counter and "
"several (usually from 3 to 8) event timers.  This hardware includes single "
"main counter with known increment frequency (10MHz or more), and several "
"programmable comparators (optionally with automatic reload feature).  When "
"value of the main counter matches current value of any comparator, interrupt "
"can be generated.  Depending on hardware capabilities and configuration, "
"interrupt can be delivered as regular I/O APIC interrupt (ISA or PCI) in "
"range from 0 to 31, or as Front Side Bus interrupt, alike to PCI MSI "
"interrupts, or in so called \"LegacyReplacement Route\" HPET can steal IRQ0 "
"of i8254 and IRQ8 of the RTC.  Interrupt can be either edge- or "
"level-triggered.  In last case they could be safely shared with PCI IRQs.  "
"Driver prefers to use FSB interrupts, if supported, to avoid sharing.  If it "
"is not possible, it uses single sharable IRQ from PCI range.  Other modes "
"(LegacyReplacement and ISA IRQs) require special care to setup, but could be "
"configured manually via device hints."

"these comparators has own unsharable IRQ."
