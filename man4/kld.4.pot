"The LKM (Loadable Kernel Modules) facility has been deprecated in E<.Fx 3.0> "
"and above in favor of the E<.Nm> interface.  This interface, like its "
"predecessor, allows the system administrator to dynamically add and remove "
"functionality from a running system.  This ability also helps software "
"developers to develop new parts of the kernel without constantly rebooting "
"to test their changes."

"Various types of modules can be loaded into the system.  There are several "
"defined module types, listed below, which can be added to the system in a "
"predefined way.  In addition, there is a generic type, for which the module "
"itself handles loading and unloading."
