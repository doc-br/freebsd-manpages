"Device is a term used mostly for hardware-related stuff that belongs to the "
"system, like disks, printers, or a graphics display with its keyboard.  "
"There are also so-called E<.Em pseudo-devices> where a device driver "
"emulates the behaviour of a device in software without any particular "
"underlying hardware.  A typical example for the latter class is E<.Pa "
"/dev/mem>, a mechanism whereby the physical memory can be accessed using "
"file access semantics."

"The device abstraction generally provides a common set of system calls, "
"which are dispatched to the corresponding device driver by the upper layers "
"of the kernel.  The set of system calls available for devices is chosen from "
"E<.Xr open 2>, E<.Xr close 2>, E<.Xr read 2>, E<.Xr write 2>, E<.Xr ioctl "
"2>, E<.Xr select 2>, and E<.Xr mmap 2>.  Not all drivers implement all "
"system calls; for example, calling E<.Xr mmap 2> on a keyboard device is not "
"likely to be useful."

"Access restrictions to device nodes are usually subject to the regular file "

"the drivers in the kernel.  But since device nodes are not stored "
"persistently between reboots, those file permissions are set at boot time "
"from rules specified in E<.Xr devfs.conf 5>, or dynamically according to "
"rules defined in E<.Xr devfs.rules 5> or set using the E<.Xr devfs 8> "
"command.  In the latter case, different rules may be used to make different "
"sets of devices visible within different instances of the E<.Xr devfs 5> "
"filesystem, which may be used, for example, to prevent jailed subsystems "
"from accessing unsafe devices.  Manual changes to device node permissions "
"may still be made, but will not persist."

"Prior to E<.Fx 5.0>, devices for disk and tape drives existed in two "
"variants, known as E<.Em block> and E<.Em character> devices, or to use "
"better terms, buffered and unbuffered (raw)  devices.  The traditional names "
"are reflected by the letters E<.Dq Li b> and E<.Dq Li c> as the file type "
"identification in the output of E<.Dq Li ls -l>.  Raw devices were "
"traditionally named with a prefix of E<.Dq Li r>, for example E<.Pa "
"/dev/rda0> would denote the raw version of the disk whose buffered device "
"was E<.Pa /dev/da0>.  E<.Em This is no longer the case>; all disk devices "

"Buffered devices were accessed through a buffer cache maintained by the "
"operating system; historically this was the system's primary disk cache, but "
"in E<.Fx> this was rendered obsolete by the introduction of unified virtual "
"memory management.  Buffered devices could be read or written at any byte "
"position, with the buffer mechanism handling the reading and writing of disk "
"blocks.  In contrast, raw disk devices can be read or written only at "
"positions and lengths that are multiples of the underlying device block "
"size, and E<.Xr write 2> calls are E<.Em synchronous>, not returning to the "
"caller until the data has been handed off to the device."
