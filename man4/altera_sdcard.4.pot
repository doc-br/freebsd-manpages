"The current version of the E<.Nm> driver supports the SD Card IP core as "
"described in the August 2011 version of Altera's documentation.  The core "
"supports only cards up to 2G (CSD 0); larger cards, or cards using newer CSD "
"versions, will not be detected.  The IP core has two key limitations: a lack "
"of interrupt support, requiring timer-driven polling to detect I/O "
"completion, and support for only single 512-byte block read and write "
"operations at a time.  The combined effect of those two limits is that the "
"system clock rate, E<.Dv HZ>, must be set to at least 200 in order to "
"accomplish the maximum 100KB/s data rate supported by the IP core."
