"The E<.Nm> policy module implements the LOMAC integrity model, which "
"protects the integrity of system objects and subjects by means of an "
"information flow policy coupled with the subject demotion via floating "
"labels.  In LOMAC, all system subjects and objects are assigned integrity "
"labels, made up of one or more hierarchical grades, depending on their "
"types.  Together, these label elements permit all labels to be placed in a "
"partial order, with information flow protections and demotion decisions "
"based on a dominance operator describing the order.  The hierarchal grade "
"field or fields are expressed as a value between 0 and 65535, with higher "
"values reflecting higher integrity."
