"There are two components in the Intel APIC system, the local APIC (LAPIC)  "
"and the I/O APIC.  There is one local APIC in each CPU in the system.  There "
"is typically one I/O APIC for each peripheral bus in the system."

"I/O APICs contain a redirection table, which is used to route the interrupts "

"Each local APIC includes one 32-bit programmable timer.  This driver uses "
"them to supply kernel with one event timer named \"LAPIC\".  Event timer "
"provided by the driver supports both one-shot an periodic modes.  Because of "
"local APIC nature it is per-CPU.  The timer frequency is not reported by the "
"platform and so automatically measured by the driver on the first use.  "
"Depending on CPU model this timer may stop in C3 and deeper CPU sleep "
"states.  Driver automatically adjusts event timer priority and reports it to "
"prevent entering dangerous sleep states when it is used."
