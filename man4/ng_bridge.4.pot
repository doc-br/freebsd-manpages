msgid ""
"The E<.Nm bridge> node type performs Ethernet bridging over one or more "
"links.  Each link (represented by a connected hook) is used to transmit and "
"receive raw Ethernet frames.  As packets are received, the node learns which "
"link each host resides on.  Packets unicast to a known host are directed out "
"the appropriate link only, and other links are spared the traffic.  This "
"behavior is in contrast to a hub, which always forwards every received "
"packet to every other link."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"The E<.Nm bridge> node incorporates a simple loop detection algorithm.  A "
"loop is when two ports are connected to the same physical medium.  Loops are "
"important to avoid because of packet storms, which severely degrade "
"performance.  A packet storm results when the same packet is sent and "
"received over and over again.  If a host is detected on link A, and is then "
"detected on link B within a certain time period after first being detected "
"on link A, then link B is considered to be a looped back link.  The time "
"period is called the minimum stable time."
