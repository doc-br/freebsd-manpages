"The E<.Nm> interface is a software discard mechanism which may be used for "
"performance analysis and software testing.  It imitates an Ethernet device, "
"which allows for its use in conjunction with such drivers as E<.Xr if_bridge "
"4> and E<.Xr vlan 4>."

"As with other network interfaces, an E<.Nm> interface must have network "
"addresses assigned for each address family with which it is to be used.  "
"These addresses may be set or changed with the E<.Dv SIOCSIFADDR> E<.Xr "
