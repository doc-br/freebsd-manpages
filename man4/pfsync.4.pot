"The E<.Nm> interface is a pseudo-device which exposes certain changes to the "
"state table used by E<.Xr pf 4>.  State changes can be viewed by invoking "
"E<.Xr tcpdump 1> on the E<.Nm> interface.  If configured with a physical "
"synchronisation interface, E<.Nm> will also send state changes out on that "
"interface, and insert state changes received on that interface from other "
"systems into the state table."

"By default, all local changes to the state table are exposed via E<.Nm>.  "

"below for more details).  The sending out of a E<.Nm> packet will be delayed "
