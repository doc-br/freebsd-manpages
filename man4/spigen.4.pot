"The E<.Nm> driver provides direct access to a slave device on the SPI bus.  "
"Each instance of a E<.Nm> device is associated with a single chip-select "
"line on the bus, and all I/O performed through that instance is done with "
"that chip-select line asserted."

"SPI data transfers are inherently bi-directional; there are not separate "
"read and write operations.  When commands and data are sent to a device, "
"data also comes back from the device, although in some cases the data may "
"not be useful (or even documented or predictable for some devices).  "
"Likewise on a read operation, whatever data is in the buffer at the start of "
"the operation is sent to (and typically ignored by) the device, with each "
"outgoing byte then replaced in the buffer by the corresponding incoming "
"byte.  Thus, all buffers passed to the transfer functions are both input and "
"output buffers."
