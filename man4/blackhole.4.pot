"The blackhole behaviour is useful to slow down an attacker who is "

"Setting the SCTP blackhole MIB to a numeric value of one will prevent "

"will do the same, but will also prevent sending an ABORT packet when "

"Normal behaviour, when a TCP SYN segment is received on a port where there "
"is no socket accepting connections, is for the system to return a RST "
"segment, and drop the connection.  The connecting system will see this as a "
"E<.Dq Connection refused>.  By setting the TCP blackhole MIB to a numeric "
"value of one, the incoming SYN segment is merely dropped, and no RST is "
"sent, making the system appear as a blackhole.  By setting the MIB value to "
"two, any segment arriving on a closed port is dropped without returning a "
"RST.  This provides some degree of protection against stealth port scans."
