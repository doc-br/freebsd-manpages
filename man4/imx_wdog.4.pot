"The E<.Nm> driver provides E<.Xr watchdog 4> support for the watchdog timer "
"present on NXP i.MX5 and i.MX6 processors.  The i.MX watchdog hardware "
"supports programmable timeouts ranging from 0.5 to 128 seconds, in "
"half-second increments.  Once activated, the watchdog hardware cannot be "
"deactivated, but the timeout period can be changed to any valid non-zero "
"value."

"At power-on, a special 16-second E<.Sq power-down timer> mode is "
"automatically enabled by the hardware.  It will assert the external WDOG_B "
"signal, which may be connected to external hardware that causes the system "
"to reset or power-down.  The power-down timer is often reset by the boot "
"loader (typically U-Boot).  If the power-down timer is still active at the "
"time when the normal watchdog is first enabled, the E<.Nm> driver "
"automatically disables it."

"The E<.Nm> driver supports the FDT E<.Va fsl,external-reset> property by "
"enabling the assertion of the WDOG_B external timeout signal when the "
"property is present.  When running this way, the need to reset the system "
"due to watchdog timeout is signaled by driving the WDOG_B line low; some "
"external entity is expected to assert the chip's POR pin in response.  The "
"E<.Nm> driver attempts to backstop this external reset by scheduling an "
"interrupt to occur as well.  The interrupt handler waits 1 second for the "
"external reset to occur, then it triggers a normal software reset.  Note "
"that the WDOG_B signal can be configured to use a variety of pins on the "
"chip.  For the E<.Va fsl,external-reset> property to be effective, the "
"signal must be connected to an appropriate pin by the system's FDT pinctrl "
"data."

"The E<.Nm> driver supports the FDT E<.Va timeout-secs> property by enabling "

"This extends watchdog protection to much of the system startup process, but "

"watchdog."
