"The E<.Nm> policy module implements the Biba integrity model, which protects "
"the integrity of system objects and subjects by means of a strict "
"information flow policy.  In Biba, all system subjects and objects are "
"assigned integrity labels, made up of hierarchal grades, and non-hierarchal "
"components.  Together, these label elements permit all labels to be placed "
"in a partial order, with information flow protections based on a dominance "
"operator describing the order.  The hierarchal grade field is expressed as a "
"value between 0 and 65535, with higher values reflecting higher integrity.  "
"The non-hierarchal compartment field is expressed as a set of up to 256 "
"components, numbered from 0 to 255.  A complete label consists of both "
"hierarchal and non-hierarchal elements."
