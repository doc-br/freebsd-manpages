"The PC keyboard is used as the console character input device.  The keyboard "
"is owned by the current virtual console.  To switch between the virtual "
"consoles use the sequence E<.Ar ALT+Fn>, which means hold down ALT and press "
"one of the function keys.  The virtual console with the same number as the "
"function key is then selected as the current virtual console and given "
"exclusive use of the keyboard and display."

"The console allows entering values that are not physically present on the "
"keyboard via a special keysequence.  To use this facility press and hold "
"down ALT, then enter a decimal number from 0-255 via the numerical keypad, "
"then release ALT.  The entered value is then used as the ASCII value for one "
"character.  This way it is possible to enter any ASCII value, not present on "
"the keyboard.  The console driver also includes a history function.  It is "
"activated by pressing the scroll-lock key.  This holds the display, and "
"enables the cursor arrows for scrolling up and down through the last "
"scrolled out lines."
