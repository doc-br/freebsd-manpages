"A E<.Em test case> is a piece of code that stress-tests a specific feature "
"of the software.  This feature is typically self-contained enough, either in "
"the amount of code that implements it or in the general idea that describes "
"it, to warrant its independent testing.  Given this, test cases are very "
"fine-grained, but they attempt to group similar smaller tests which are "
"semantically related."

"A test case is defined by three components regardless of the language it is "
"implemented in: a header, a body and a cleanup routine.  The E<.Em header> "
"is, basically, a declarative piece of code that defines several properties "
"to describe what the test case does and how it behaves.  In other words: it "
"defines the test case's E<.Em meta-data>, further described in the E<.Sx "
"Meta-data> section.  The E<.Em body> is the test case itself.  It executes "
"all actions needed to reproduce the test, and checks for failures.  This "
"body is only executed if the abstract conditions specified by the header are "
"met.  The E<.Em cleanup> routine is a piece of code always executed after "
"the body, regardless of the exit status of the test case.  It can be used to "
"undo side-effects of the test case.  Note that almost all side-effects of a "
"test case are automatically cleaned up by the library; this is explained in "
"more detail in the rest of this document."
