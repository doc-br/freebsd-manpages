"In a E<.Nm> architecture, the latency to access specific memory or IO "
"devices depends upon which processor the memory or device is attached to.  "
"Accessing memory local to a processor is faster than accessing memory that "
"is connected to one of the other processors.  E<.Fx> implements NUMA-aware "
"memory allocation policies.  By default it attempts to ensure that "
"allocations are balanced across each domain.  Users may override the default "
"domain selection policy using E<.Xr cpuset 1>."
