"The E<.Nm> module provides generic code to support 802.11 drivers.  Where a "

"E<.Nm> supports multi-mode devices capable of operating in both 2.4GHz and "

"802.11g, 802.11n, and 802.11s (Draft 3.0).  The WPA, 802.11i, and 802.1x "
"security protocols are supported through a combination of in-kernel code and "
"user-mode applications.  The WME/WMM multi-media protocols are supported "
"entirely within the E<.Nm> module but require a suitably capable hardware "
"device.  Likewise the 802.11h specification is supported only by suitably "
