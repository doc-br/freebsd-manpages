"Starting with Intel Westmere and AMD Bulldozer, some x86 processors "
"implement a new set of instructions called AESNI.  The set of six "
"instructions accelerates the calculation of the key schedule for key lengths "
"of 128, 192, and 256 of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric "
"cipher, and provides a hardware implementation of the regular and the last "
"encryption and decryption rounds."

"The E<.Nm> driver does not attach on systems that lack both CPU "
"capabilities.  On systems that support only one of AESNI or SHA extensions, "
"the driver will attach and support that one function."

"The E<.Nm> driver registers itself to accelerate AES and SHA operations for "
"E<.Xr crypto 4>.  Besides speed, the advantage of using the E<.Nm> driver is "
"that the AESNI operation is data-independent, thus eliminating some attack "
"vectors based on measuring cache use and timings typically present in "
"table-driven implementations."
