"The E<.Nm> driver provides support for wireless network adapters based on "
"the Atheros AR5210, AR5211, AR5212, AR5416 and AR9300 programming APIs.  "
"These APIs are used by a wide variety of chips; most all chips with a PCI "
"and/or CardBus interface are supported."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/ath.4:67
msgid ""
"Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management, BSS, "
"IBSS, MBSS, TDMA, and host-based access point operation modes.  All "
"host/device interaction is via DMA."

"Please note that from FreeBSD-9.0, the E<.Nm> driver does not include the "

"including PCI/PCIe, but also embedded (AHB) and USB in the future."

"The E<.Nm> driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, "
"however it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.  Transmit speed and "
"operating mode is selectable and depends on the specific chipset.  "
"AR5210-based devices support 802.11a operation with transmit speeds of 6 "
"Mbps, 9 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 24 Mbps, 36 Mbps, 48 Mbps, and 54 Mbps.  "
"AR5211-based devices support 802.11a and 802.11b operation with transmit "
"speeds as above for 802.11a operation and 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5 Mbps and 11Mbps "
"for 802.11b operation.  AR5212-based devices support 802.11a, 802.11b, and "
"802.11g operation with transmit speeds appropriate to each.  AR5416 and "
"later class devices are capable of 802.11n operation.  Most chips also "
"support an Atheros Turbo Mode (TM) that operates in the 5GHz frequency range "
"with 2x the transmit speeds.  Some chips also support Turbo mode in the "
"2.4GHz range with 802.11g though this support is not presently available due "
"to regulatory requirements.  (Note that Turbo modes are, however, only "
"interoperable with other Atheros-based devices.)  AR5212-based and "
"AR5416-based devices also support half- (10MHz) and quarter-width (5MHz) "
"channels.  The actual transmit speed used is dependent on signal quality and "
"the E<.Dq \"rate control\"> algorithm employed by the driver.  All chips "
"support WEP encryption.  AR5212, AR5416 and later parts have hardware "
"support for the AES-CCM, TKIP, and Michael cryptographic operations required "
"for WPA.  To enable encryption, use E<.Xr ifconfig 8> as shown below."

"the U/L bits in the mac address assigned to the underlying device.  Any "
"number of E<.Cm wds> virtual interfaces may be configured together with "
"E<.Cm hostap> interfaces.  Multiple E<.Cm station> interfaces may be "
