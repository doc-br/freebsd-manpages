"Aironet 4500 series adapters operate at 1 and 2Mbps while the Aironet 4800 "

"have the same programming interface, however unlike the Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE "
"cards, the ISA and PCI cards appear to the host as normal ISA and PCI "

"The PCMCIA Aironet cards require PC Card support, including the kernel E<.Xr "
"pccard 4> driver.  ISA cards can either be configured to use ISA Plug and "
"Play or to use a particular I/O address and IRQ by properly setting the DIP "
"switches on the board.  (The default switch setting is for Plug and Play.)  "
"The E<.Nm> driver has Plug and Play support and will work in either "
"configuration, however when using a hard-wired I/O address and IRQ, the "
"driver configuration and the NIC's switch settings must agree.  PCI cards "
"require no switch settings of any kind and will be automatically probed and "
"attached."
