"If a E<.Nm> is interleaved correctly, a E<.Dq striping> effect is achieved, "
"which can increase sequential read/write performance.  The interleave factor "
"is expressed in units of E<.Dv DEV_BSIZE> (usually 512 bytes).  For large "
"writes, the optimum interleave factor is typically the size of a track, "
"while for large reads, it is about a quarter of a track.  (Note that this "
"changes greatly depending on the number and speed of disks.)  For instance, "
"with eight 7,200 RPM drives on two Fast-Wide SCSI buses, this translates to "
"about 128 for writes and 32 for reads.  A larger interleave tends to work "
"better when the disk is taking a multitasking load by localizing the file "
"I/O from any given process onto a single disk.  You lose sequential "
"performance when you do this, but sequential performance is not usually an "
"issue with a multitasking load."

"An interleave factor must be specified when using a mirroring configuration, "
"even when you have only two disks (i.e., the layout winds up being the same "
"no matter what the interleave factor).  The interleave factor will determine "
"how I/O is broken up, however, and a value 128 or greater is recommended."

"You can configure the E<.Nm> to E<.Dq mirror> any even number of disks.  See "
"E<.Xr ccdconfig 8> for how to specify the necessary flags.  For example, if "
"you have a E<.Nm> configuration specifying four disks, the first two disks "
"will be mirrored with the second two disks.  A write will be run to both "
"sides of the mirror.  A read will be run to either side of the mirror "
"depending on what the driver believes to be most optimal.  If the read "
"fails, the driver will automatically attempt to read the same sector from "
"the other side of the mirror.  Currently E<.Nm> uses a dual seek zone model "
