"A E<.Nm socket> node is both a E<.Bx> socket and a netgraph node.  The "
"E<.Nm> node type allows user-mode processes to participate in the kernel "
"E<.Xr netgraph 4> networking subsystem using the E<.Bx> socket interface.  "
"The process must have root privileges to be able to create netgraph sockets "
"however once created, any process that has one may use it."

"A new E<.Nm> node is created by creating a new socket of type E<.Dv "
"NG_CONTROL> in the protocol family E<.Dv PF_NETGRAPH>, using the E<.Xr "
"socket 2> system call.  Any control messages received by the node and not "
"having a cookie value of E<.Dv NGM_SOCKET_COOKIE> are received by the "
"process, using E<.Xr recvfrom 2>; the socket address argument is a E<.Dv "
"\"struct sockaddr_ng\"> containing the sender's netgraph address.  "
"Conversely, control messages can be sent to any node by calling E<.Xr sendto "
"2>, supplying the recipient's address in a E<.Dv \"struct sockaddr_ng\">.  "
"The E<.Xr bind 2> system call may be used to assign a global netgraph name "

"they are bound to a specific node via the E<.Xr connect 2> system call.  The "
"address argument is the netgraph address of the E<.Nm> node already "
"created.  Once a data socket is associated with a node, any data packets "
"received by the node are read using E<.Xr recvfrom 2> and any packets to be "
"sent out from the node are written using E<.Xr sendto 2>.  In the case of "
"data sockets, the E<.Dv \"struct sockaddr_ng\"> contains the name of the "
