"The E<.Nm ntb_hw_intel> driver provides support for the Non-Transparent "
"Bridge (NTB) hardware in Intel Xeon E3/E5 and S1200 processor families, "
"which allow one of their PCIe ports to be switched from transparent to "
"non-transparent bridge mode.  In this mode bridge looks not as a PCI bridge, "
"but as PCI endpoint device.  The driver hides hardware details, exposing "
"memory windows, scratchpads and doorbells of the other side via hardware "
"independent KPI to E<.Xr ntb 4> subsystem."

"The hardware provides 2 or 3 memory windows to the other system's memory, 16 "
"scratchpad registers and 14 or 34 doorbells to interrupt the other system.  "
"On Xeon processors one of memory windows is typically consumed by the driver "
"itself to workaround multiple hardware erratas."
