"The E<.Nm> policy module implements the Multi-Level Security, or MLS model, "
"which controls access between subjects and objects based on their "
"confidentiality by means of a strict information flow policy.  Each subject "
"and object in the system has an MLS label associated with it; each subject's "
"MLS label contains information on its clearance level, and each object's MLS "
"label contains information on its classification."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/mac_mls.4:79
msgid ""
"In MLS, all system subjects and objects are assigned confidentiality labels, "
"made up of a sensitivity level and zero or more compartments.  Together, "
"these label elements permit all labels to be placed in a partial order, with "
"confidentiality protections based on a dominance operator describing the "
"order.  The sensitivity level is expressed as a value between 0 and 65535, "
"with higher values reflecting higher sensitivity levels.  The compartment "
"field is expressed as a set of up to 256 components, numbered from 1 to "
"256.  A complete label consists of both sensitivity and compartment "
"elements."

"With normal labels, dominance is defined as a label having a higher or equal "

"which it is being compared, and E<.Dq Li higher> is defined as dominating "
