msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> Khelp module works within the E<.Xr khelp 9> framework to provide "
"TCP with a per-connection, low noise estimate of the instantaneous RTT.  The "
"implementation attempts to be robust in the face of delayed "
"acknowledgements, TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO), receivers who manipulate "
"TCP timestamps and lack of the TCP timestamp option altogether."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/h_ertt.4:60
msgid ""
"TCP receivers using delayed acknowledgements either acknowledge every second "
"packet (reflecting the time stamp of the first) or use a timeout to trigger "
"the acknowledgement if no second packet arrives.  If the heuristic used by "
"E<.Nm> determines that the receiver is using delayed acknowledgements, it "
"measures the RTT using the second packet (the one that triggers the "
"acknowledgement).  It does not measure the RTT if the acknowledgement is for "
"the first packet, since it cannot be accurately determined."

"When TSO is in use, E<.Nm> will momentarily disable TSO whilst marking a "
