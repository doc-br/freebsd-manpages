"Every process is associated with a particular process group and session.  "
"The grouping is hierarchical: every member of a particular process group is "
"a member of the same session.  This structuring is used in managing groups "
"of related processes for purposes of E<.Em \"job control\">; that is, the "
"ability from the keyboard (or from program control) to simultaneously stop "
"or restart a complex command (a command composed of one or more related "
"processes).  The grouping into process groups allows delivering of signals "
"that stop or start the group as a whole, along with arbitrating which "
"process group has access to the single controlling terminal.  The grouping "
"at a higher layer into sessions is to restrict the job control related "
"signals and system calls to within processes resulting from a particular "
"instance of a E<.Dq login>.  Typically, a session is created when a user "
"logs in, and the login terminal is setup to be the controlling terminal; all "
"processes spawned from that login shell are in the same session, and inherit "
"the controlling terminal."

"A job control shell operating interactively (that is, reading commands from "
"a terminal)  normally groups related processes together by placing them into "
"the same process group.  A set of processes in the same process group is "
"collectively referred to as a E<.Dq job>.  When the foreground process group "
"of the terminal is the same as the process group of a particular job, that "
"job is said to be in the E<.Dq foreground>.  When the process group of the "
"terminal is different from the process group of a job (but is still the "
"controlling terminal), that job is said to be in the E<.Dq background>.  "
"Normally the shell reads a command and starts the job that implements that "
"command.  If the command is to be started in the foreground (typical), it "
"sets the process group of the terminal to the process group of the started "
"job, waits for the job to complete, and then sets the process group of the "
"terminal back to its own process group (it puts itself into the "
"foreground).  If the job is to be started in the background (as denoted by "
"the shell operator \"&\"), it never changes the process group of the "
"terminal and does not wait for the job to complete (that is, it immediately "
"attempts to read the next command).  If the job is started in the "
"foreground, the user may type a key (usually E<.Ql \\&^Z>)  which generates "
"the terminal stop signal E<.Pq Dv SIGTSTP> and has the effect of stopping "
"the entire job.  The shell will notice that the job stopped, and will resume "
"running after placing itself in the foreground.  The shell also has commands "
"for placing stopped jobs in the background, and for placing stopped or "
"background jobs into the foreground."
