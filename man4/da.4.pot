"solid-state devices."

"Many direct access devices are equipped with read and/or write caches.  "
"Parameters affecting the device's cache are stored in mode page 8, the "
"caching control page.  Mode pages can be examined and modified via the E<.Xr "
"camcontrol 8> utility."

"The read cache is used to store data from device-initiated read ahead "
"operations as well as frequently used data.  The read cache is transparent "
"to the user and can be enabled without any adverse effect.  Most devices "
"with a read cache come from the factory with it enabled.  The read cache can "
"be disabled by setting the E<.Tn RCD> (Read Cache Disable) bit in the "
"caching control mode page."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/da.4:96
msgid ""
"The write cache can greatly decrease the latency of write operations and "
"allows the device to reorganize writes to increase efficiency and "
"performance.  This performance gain comes at a price.  Should the device "
"lose power while its cache contains uncommitted write operations, these "
"writes will be lost.  The effect of a loss of write transactions on a file "
"system is non-deterministic and can cause corruption.  Most devices age "
"write transactions to limit vulnerability to a few transactions recently "
"reported as complete, but it is none-the-less recommended that systems with "
"write cache enabled devices reside on an Uninterruptible Power Supply "
"(UPS).  The E<.Nm> device driver ensures that the cache and media are "
"synchronized upon final close of the device or an unexpected shutdown "
"(panic) event.  This ensures that it is safe to disconnect power once the "
"operating system has reported that it has halted.  The write cache can be "
"enabled by setting the E<.Tn WCE> (Write Cache Enable) bit in the caching "
"control mode page."

"The E<.Nm> device driver will take full advantage of the SCSI feature known "
"as tagged queueing.  Tagged queueing allows the device to process multiple "
"transactions concurrently, often re-ordering them to reduce the number and "
"length of seeks.  To ensure that transactions to distant portions of the "
"media, which may be deferred indefinitely by servicing requests nearer the "
"current head position, are completed in a timely fashion, an ordered tagged "
"transaction is sent every 15 seconds during continuous device operation."
