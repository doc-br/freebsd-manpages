#. .Sh ARP level load balancing
#. A
#. .Nm
#. interface has limited abilities for load balancing incoming connections
#. between hosts in an Ethernet network.
#. For load-balancing operation, one needs several CARP interfaces that
#. are configured to the same IP address, but to a different vhids.
#. Once an ARP request is received, the CARP protocol will use a hashing
#. function against the source IP address in the ARP request to determine
#. which vhid the request will be assigned to.
#. If the corresponding CARP interface is the current
#. master interface, a reply will
#. be sent to the ARP request;
#. otherwise it will be ignored.
#. See the
#. .Sx EXAMPLES
#. section for a practical example of load balancing.
#. .Pp
#. The ARP load balancing implemented in
#. .Nm
#. has some limitations.
#. First, ARP balancing only works on the local network segment.
#. It cannot balance traffic that crosses a router, because the
#. router itself will always be balanced to the same virtual host.
#. Second, ARP load balancing can lead to asymmetric routing
#. of incoming and outgoing traffic, and thus combining it with
#. .Xr pfsync 4
#. is dangerous, because this creates a race condition between
#. balanced routers and a host they are serving.
#. Imagine an incoming packet creating state on the first router, being
#. forwarded to its destination, and the destination replying faster
#. than the state information is packed and synced with the second router.
#. If the reply would be load balanced to second router, it will be
#. dropped since the second router has not yet received information about
#. the connection state.

#. .Pp
#. In order to set up an ARP balanced virtual host, it is necessary to configure
#. one virtual host for each physical host which would respond to ARP requests
#. and thus handle the traffic.
#. In the following example, two virtual hosts are configured on two hosts to
#. provide balancing and failover for the IP address 192.168.1.10.
#. .Pp
#. First the
#. .Nm
#. interfaces on host A are configured.
#. The
#. .Cm advskew
#. of 100 on the second virtual host means that its advertisements will be sent
#. out slightly less frequently.
#. .Bd -literal -offset indent
#. ifconfig carp0 create
#. ifconfig carp0 vhid 1 advskew 100 pass mekmitasdigoat 192.168.1.10/24
#. ifconfig carp1 create
#. ifconfig carp1 vhid 2 advskew 200 pass mekmitasdigoat 192.168.1.10/24
#. .Ed
#. .Pp
#. The configuration for host B is identical, except the
#. .Cm advskew
#. is on virtual host 1 rather than virtual host 2.
#. .Bd -literal -offset indent
#. ifconfig carp0 create
#. ifconfig carp0 vhid 1 advskew 200 pass mekmitasdigoat 192.168.1.10/24
#. ifconfig carp1 create
#. ifconfig carp1 vhid 2 advskew 100 pass mekmitasdigoat 192.168.1.10/24
#. .Ed
#. .Pp
#. Finally, the ARP balancing feature must be enabled on both hosts:
#. .Pp
#. .Dl sysctl net.inet.carp.arpbalance=1
#. .Pp
#. When the hosts receive an ARP request for 192.168.1.10, the source IP address
#. of the request is used to compute which virtual host should answer the request.
#. The host which is master of the selected virtual host will reply to the
#. request, the other(s) will ignore it.
#. .Pp
#. This way, locally connected systems will receive different ARP replies and
#. subsequent IP traffic will be balanced among the hosts.
#. If one of the hosts fails, the other will take over the virtual MAC address,
#. and begin answering ARP requests on its behalf.
