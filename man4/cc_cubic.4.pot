#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"The CUBIC congestion control algorithm was designed to provide increased "
"throughput in fast and long-distance networks.  It attempts to maintain "
"fairness when competing with legacy NewReno TCP in lower speed scenarios "
"where NewReno is able to operate adequately."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/cc_cubic.4:54
msgid ""
"The congestion window is increased as a function of the time elapsed since "
"the last congestion event.  During regular operation, the window increase "
"function follows a cubic function, with the inflection point set to be the "
"congestion window value reached at the last congestion event.  CUBIC also "
"calculates an estimate of the congestion window that NewReno would have "
"achieved at a given time after a congestion event.  When updating the "
"congestion window, the algorithm will choose the larger of the calculated "
"CUBIC and estimated NewReno windows."

"CUBIC also backs off less on congestion by changing the multiplicative "
"decrease factor from 1/2 (used by standard NewReno TCP) to 4/5."
