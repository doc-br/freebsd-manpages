msgid ""
"The E<.Tn TCP> protocol provides reliable, flow-controlled, two-way "
"transmission of data.  It is a byte-stream protocol used to support the "
"E<.Dv SOCK_STREAM> abstraction.  E<.Tn TCP> uses the standard Internet "
"address format and, in addition, provides a per-host collection of E<.Dq "
"\"port addresses\">.  Thus, each address is composed of an Internet address "
"specifying the host and network, with a specific E<.Tn TCP> port on the host "
"identifying the peer entity."

"Sockets utilizing the E<.Tn TCP> protocol are either E<.Dq active> or E<.Dq "
"passive>.  Active sockets initiate connections to passive sockets.  By "
"default, E<.Tn TCP> sockets are created active; to create a passive socket, "
"the E<.Xr listen 2> system call must be used after binding the socket with "
"the E<.Xr bind 2> system call.  Only passive sockets may use the E<.Xr "
"accept 2> call to accept incoming connections.  Only active sockets may use "

"Passive sockets may E<.Dq underspecify> their location to match incoming "
"connection requests from multiple networks.  This technique, termed E<.Dq "
"\"wildcard addressing\">, allows a single server to provide service to "
"clients on multiple networks.  To create a socket which listens on all "
"networks, the Internet address E<.Dv INADDR_ANY> must be bound.  The E<.Tn "
"TCP> port may still be specified at this time; if the port is not specified, "
"the system will assign one.  Once a connection has been established, the "
"socket's address is fixed by the peer entity's location.  The address "
"assigned to the socket is the address associated with the network interface "
"through which packets are being transmitted and received.  Normally, this "
