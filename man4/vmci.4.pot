"VMCI allows virtual machines to communicate with host kernel modules and the "
"VMware hypervisors.  User level applications in a virtual machine can use "
"VMCI through vSockets (also known as VMCI Sockets and not included in this "
"kernel module), a socket address family designed to be compatible with UDP "
"and TCP at the interface level.  Today, VMCI and vSockets are used by "
"various VMware Tools components inside the guest for zero-config, "
"network-less access to VMware host services.  In addition to this, VMware's "
"users are using vSockets for various applications, where network access of "
"the virtual machine is restricted or non-existent.  Examples of this are VMs "
"communicating with device proxies for proprietary hardware running as host "
"applications and automated testing of applications running within virtual "
"machines."

"In a virtual machine, VMCI is exposed as a regular PCI device.  The primary "
"communication mechanisms supported are a point-to-point bidirectional "
"transport based on a pair of memory-mapped queues, and asynchronous "
"notifications in the form of datagrams and doorbells.  These features are "
"available to kernel level components such as vSockets through the VMCI "
"kernel API.  In addition to this, the VMCI kernel API provides support for "
"receiving events related to the state of the VMCI communication channels, "
"and the virtual machine itself."
