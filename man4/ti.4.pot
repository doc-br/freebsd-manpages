"The E<.Nm> driver provides support for PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapters based "
"on the Alteon Networks Tigon Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.  The Tigon "
"contains an embedded R4000 CPU, gigabit MAC, dual DMA channels and a PCI "
"interface unit.  The Tigon II contains two R4000 CPUs and other "
"refinements.  Either chip can be used in either a 32-bit or 64-bit PCI "
"slot.  Communication with the chip is achieved via PCI shared memory and bus "
"master DMA.  The Tigon I and II support hardware multicast address "
"filtering, VLAN tag extraction and insertion, and jumbo Ethernet frames "
"sizes up to 9000 bytes.  Note that the Tigon I chipset is no longer in "
"active production: all new adapters should come equipped with Tigon II "
"chipsets."
