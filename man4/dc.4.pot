"The E<.Nm> driver programs 82c168 and 82c169 PNIC chips to use the store and "
"forward setting for the transmit start threshold by default.  This is to "
"work around problems with some NIC/PCI bus combinations where the PNIC can "
"transmit corrupt frames when operating at 100Mbps, probably due to PCI DMA "
"burst transfer errors."

"The 82c168 and 82c169 PNIC chips also have a receiver bug that sometimes "
"manifests during periods of heavy receive and transmit activity, where the "
"chip will improperly DMA received frames to the host.  The chips appear to "
"upload several kilobytes of garbage data along with the received frame data, "
"dirtying several RX buffers instead of just the expected one.  The E<.Nm> "
"driver detects this condition and will salvage the frame; however, it incurs "
"a serious performance penalty in the process."

"The PNIC chips also sometimes generate a transmit underrun error when the "
"driver attempts to download the receiver filter setup frame, which can "
"result in the receive filter being incorrectly programmed.  The E<.Nm> "
"driver will watch for this condition and requeue the setup frame until it is "
"transferred successfully."

"The ADMtek AL981 chip (and possibly the AN985 as well) has been observed to "
"sometimes wedge on transmit: this appears to happen when the driver queues a "
"sequence of frames which cause it to wrap from the end of the transmit "
"descriptor ring back to the beginning.  The E<.Nm> driver attempts to avoid "
"this condition by not queuing any frames past the end of the transmit ring "
"during a single invocation of the E<.Fn dc_start> routine.  This workaround "
"has a negligible impact on transmit performance."
