"The E<.Dv PAE> option provides support for the physical address extensions "
"capability of the E<.Tn Intel> E<.Tn Pentium Pro> and above CPUs, and allows "
"for up to 64 gigabytes of memory to be used in systems capable of supporting "
"it.  With the E<.Dv PAE> option, memory above 4 gigabytes is simply added to "
"the general page pool.  The system makes no distinction between memory above "
"or below 4 gigabytes, and no specific facility is provided for a process or "
"the kernel to access more memory than they would otherwise be able to "
"access, through a sliding window or otherwise."

"Many devices or their device drivers are not capable of direct memory access "
"to physical addresses above 4 gigabytes.  In order to make use of direct "
"memory access IO in a system with more than 4 gigabytes of memory when the "
"E<.Dv PAE> option is used, these drivers must use a facility for remapping "
"or substituting physical memory which is not accessible to the device.  One "
"such facility is provided by the E<.Nm busdma> interface.  Device drivers "
"which do not account for such devices will not work reliably in a system "
"with more than 4 gigabytes of memory when the E<.Dv PAE> option is used, and "
"may cause data corruption.  The E<.Pa PAE> kernel configuration file "
"includes the E<.Dv PAE> option, and explicitly excludes all device drivers "
"which are known to not work or have not been tested in a system with the "
"E<.Dv PAE> option and more than 4 gigabytes of memory."

"Many parameters which determine how memory is used in the kernel are based "
"on the amount of physical memory.  The formulas used to determine the values "
"of these parameters for specific memory configurations may not take into "
"account the fact there may be more than 4 gigabytes of memory, and may not "
"scale well to these memory configurations.  In particular, it may be "
"necessary to increase the amount of virtual address space available to the "
"kernel, or to reduce the amount of a specific resource that is heavily used, "
"in order to avoid running out of virtual address space.  The E<.Dv "
"KVA_PAGES> option may be used to increase the kernel virtual address space, "
"and the E<.Va kern.maxvnodes> E<.Xr sysctl 8> may be used to decrease the "
"number of vnodes allowed, an example of a resource that the kernel is likely "
"to overallocate in large memory configurations.  For optimal performance and "
"stability it may be necessary to consult the E<.Xr tuning 7> manual page, "
"and make adjustments to the parameters documented there."
