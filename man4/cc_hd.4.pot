msgid ""
"The HD congestion control algorithm is an implementation of the Hamilton "
"Institute's delay-based congestion control which aims to keep network "
"queuing delays below a particular threshold (queue_threshold)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/cc_hd.4:47
msgid ""
"HD probabilistically reduces the congestion window (cwnd) based on its "
"estimate of the network queuing delay.  The probability of reducing cwnd is "
"zero at hd_qmin or less, rising to a maximum at queue_threshold, and then "
"back to zero at the maximum queuing delay."

#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/cc_hd.4:54
msgid ""
"Loss-based congestion control algorithms such as NewReno probe for network "
"capacity by filling queues until there is a packet loss.  HD competes with "
"loss-based congestion control algorithms by allowing its probability of "
"reducing cwnd to drop from a maximum at queue_threshold to be zero at the "
"maximum queuing delay.  This has been shown to work well when the bottleneck "
"link is highly multiplexed."
