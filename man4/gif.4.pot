"The E<.Nm> interface is a generic tunnelling device for IPv4 and IPv6.  It "
"can tunnel IPv[46] traffic over IPv[46].  Therefore, there can be four "
"possible configurations.  The behavior of E<.Nm> is mainly based on RFC2893 "
"IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnel.  On E<.Nx>, E<.Nm> can also tunnel ISO "
"traffic over IPv[46] using EON encapsulation.  Note that E<.Nm> does not "
"perform GRE encapsulation; use E<.Xr gre 4> for GRE encapsulation."

"To use E<.Nm>, the administrator needs to configure the protocol and "
"addresses used for the outer header.  This can be done by using E<.Xr "
"ifconfig 8> E<.Cm tunnel>, or E<.Dv SIOCSIFPHYADDR> ioctl.  The "
"administrator also needs to configure the protocol and addresses for the "
"inner header, with E<.Xr ifconfig 8>.  Note that IPv6 link-local addresses "
"(those that start with E<.Li fe80::>)  will be automatically configured "
"whenever possible.  You may need to remove IPv6 link-local addresses "
"manually using E<.Xr ifconfig 8>, if you want to disable the use of IPv6 as "
"the inner header (for example, if you need a pure IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel).  "
