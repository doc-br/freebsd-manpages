"The E<.Nm> provides a high performance communication interface between guest "
"and root partitions in Hyper-V.  Hyper-V is a hypervisor-based "
"virtualization technology from Microsoft.  Hyper-V supports isolation in "
"terms of a partition.  A partition is a logical unit of isolation, supported "
"by the hypervisor, in which operating systems execute."

"The Microsoft hypervisor must have at least one parent, or root, partition, "
"running Windows Server operating system.  The virtualization stack runs in "
"the parent partition and has direct access to the hardware devices.  The "
"root partition then creates the child partitions which host the guest "
"operating systems."

"Child partitions do not have direct access to other hardware resources and "
"are presented a virtual view of the resources, as virtual devices (VDevs).  "
"Requests to the virtual devices are redirected either via the VMBus or the "

"The VMBus is a logical inter-partition communication channel.  The parent "
"partition hosts Virtualization Service Providers (VSPs)  which communicate "
"over the VMBus to handle device access requests from child partitions.  "
"Child partitions host Virtualization Service Consumers (VSCs) which redirect "
"device requests to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus.  The Hyper-V "
"VMBus driver defines and implements the interface that facilitate high "
"performance bi-directional communication between the VSCs and VSPs.  All "
