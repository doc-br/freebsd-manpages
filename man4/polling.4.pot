msgid ""
"Device polling E<.Nm (> for brevity) refers to a technique that lets the "
"operating system periodically poll devices, instead of relying on the "
"devices to generate interrupts when they need attention.  This might seem "
"inefficient and counterintuitive, but when done properly, E<.Nm> gives more "
"control to the operating system on when and how to handle devices, with a "
"number of advantages in terms of system responsiveness and performance."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/polling.4:55
msgid ""
"In particular, E<.Nm> reduces the overhead for context switches which is "
"incurred when servicing interrupts, and gives more control on the scheduling "
"of the CPU between various tasks (user processes, software interrupts, "
"device handling)  which ultimately reduces the chances of livelock in the "
"system."

"In the normal, interrupt-based mode, devices generate an interrupt whenever "
"they need attention.  This in turn causes a context switch and the execution "
"of an interrupt handler which performs whatever processing is needed by the "
"device.  The duration of the interrupt handler is potentially unbounded "
"unless the device driver has been programmed with real-time concerns in mind "
"(which is generally not the case for E<.Fx> drivers).  Furthermore, under "
"heavy traffic load, the system might be persistently processing interrupts "
"without being able to complete other work, either in the kernel or in "
"userland."

"Device polling disables interrupts by polling devices at appropriate times, "
"i.e., on clock interrupts and within the idle loop.  This way, the context "
"switch overhead is removed.  Furthermore, the operating system can control "
"accurately how much work to spend in handling device events, and thus "
"prevent livelock by reserving some amount of CPU to other tasks."

"Enabling E<.Nm> also changes the way software network interrupts are "
