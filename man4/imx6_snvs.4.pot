"E<.Sq SNVS> stands for Secure Non-Volatile Storage, and refers to the "
"subsystem within the chip that (optionally) remains powered by a battery "
"when the rest of the system is powered down.  The on-chip realtime clock is "
"part of that subsystem.  Other features of the SNVS subsystem are related to "
"security, tamper monitoring, and power control; the E<.Nm> driver does not "
"currently support those features."

"Many i.MX6 systems do not use a battery to provide power to the SNVS due to "
"its relatively high power draw.  In such systems, this driver is able to "
"provide a very accurate time following a reboot, but cannot provide time at "
"all if the power is cycled.  If the system provides an i2c or other type of "
"alternate realtime clock with lower resolution, there is value in "
"configuring both clock drivers.  Doing so allows SNVS to provide accurate "
"time after a reboot, while the external clock provides approximate time "
"after power cycling."
