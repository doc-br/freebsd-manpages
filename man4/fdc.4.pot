"Floppy disk controllers can connect up to four drives each.  The E<.Nm> "
"driver can currently handle up to two drives per controller (or four drives "
"on ACPI).  Upon driver initialization, an attempt is made to find out the "
"type of the floppy controller in use.  The known controller types are either "
"the original NE765 or i8272 chips, or alternatively E<.Em enhanced> "
"controllers that are compatible with the NE72065 or i82077 chips.  These "
"enhanced controllers (among other enhancements) implement a FIFO for floppy "
"data transfers that will automatically be enabled once an enhanced chip has "
"been detected.  This FIFO activation can be disabled using the "
"per-controller flags value of E<.Ar 0x1>."

"By default, this driver creates a single device node E<.Pa /dev/fd Ns Ar N> "

"device nodes that use a trailing UFS-style partition letter (ranging from "
"E<.Sq a> through E<.Sq h>)  can also be accessed, which will be implemented "

"Accessing the main device node will attempt to autodetect the density of the "
"available medium for multi-density devices.  Thus it is possible to use "
"either a 720 KB medium or a 1440 KB medium in a high-density 3.5 inch "
"standard floppy drive.  Normally, this autodetection will only happen once "
"at the first call to E<.Xr open 2> for the device after inserting the "
"medium.  This assumes the drive offers proper changeline support so media "
"changes can be detected by the driver.  To indicate a drive that does not "

"policy how to assign these numbers.  The two common policies are to either "
