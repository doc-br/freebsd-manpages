#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"The H-TCP congestion control algorithm was designed to provide increased "
"throughput in fast and long-distance networks.  It attempts to maintain "
"fairness when competing with legacy NewReno TCP in lower speed scenarios "
"where NewReno is able to operate adequately."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/cc_htcp.4:50
msgid ""
"The congestion window is increased as a function of the time elapsed since "
"the last congestion event.  The window increase algorithm operates like "
"NewReno for the first second after a congestion event, and then switches to "
"a high-speed mode based on a quadratic increase function."
