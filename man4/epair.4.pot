"The E<.Nm> is a pair of Ethernet-like software interfaces, which are "
"connected back-to-back with a virtual cross-over cable."

"Each E<.Nm> interface pair is created at runtime using interface cloning.  "
"This is most easily done with the E<.Xr ifconfig 8> E<.Cm create> command or "
"using the E<.Va cloned_interfaces> variable in E<.Xr rc.conf 5>.  While for "
"cloning you only give either E<.Pa epair> or E<.Pa epairE<lt>nE<gt>> the "
"E<.Nm> pair will be named like E<.Pa epairE<lt>nE<gt>[ab]>.  This means the "
"names of the first E<.Nm> interfaces will be E<.Pa epair0a> and E<.Pa "
"epair0b>."

"Like any other Ethernet interface, an E<.Nm> needs to have a network "
"address.  Each E<.Nm> will be assigned a locally administered address by "
"default, that is only guaranteed to be unique within one network stack.  To "
"change the default addresses one may use the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2) or "
"ifconfig(8) utility."

"The basic intent is to provide connectivity between two virtual network "
"stack instances.  When connected to an E<.Xr if_bridge 4>, one end of the "
"interface pair can also be part of another (virtual) LAN.  As with any other "
"Ethernet interface, E<.Nm epair> can have a E<.Xr vlan 4> configured on top "
"of it."
