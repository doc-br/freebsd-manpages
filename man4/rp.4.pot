"This driver provides a kernel device driver for the E<.Tn RocketPort> and "
"E<.Tn RocketPort RA> serial boards.  These boards provide 8, 16, or 32 "
"high-speed serial ports while requiring only 68 bytes of I/O space for all "
"8, 16, or 32 ports, and do not require an interrupt channel.  This driver "
"supports up to four E<.Tn RocketPort> or E<.Tn RocketPort RA> boards in one "
"machine simultaneously.  If you are using four 32 port E<.Tn RocketPort> "
"boards, you can put as many as 128 intelligent serial ports on your system."
