"functionality in the integrated Memory Controllers (iMCs) embedded in Intel "
"Sandybridge-Xeon, Ivybridge-Xeon, Haswell-Xeon, and Broadwell-Xeon CPUs.  "
"Each CPU implements one or more iMCs, depending on the number of cores; each "
"iMC implements two SMBus controllers (iMC-SMBs).  The iMC-SMBs are used by "
"the iMCs to read configuration information from the DIMMs during POST.  They "
