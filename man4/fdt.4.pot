"E<.Em Flattened Device Tree> is a mechanism for describing computer hardware "
"resources, which cannot be probed or self enumerated, in a uniform and "
"portable way.  The primary consumers of this technology are E<.Em embedded "
"systems,> where a lot of designs are based on similar chips, but have "
"different assignment of pins, memory layout, addresses bindings, interrupts "
"routing and other resources."

"Configuration data, which cannot be self discovered in run-time, has to be "
"supplied from external source.  The concept of a flattened device tree is a "
"platform and architecture independent approach for resolving such problems.  "
"The idea is inherited from Open Firmware IEEE 1275 device-tree notion, and "
"has been successfully adopted by the embedded industry.  The scheme works in "
"the following way:"
