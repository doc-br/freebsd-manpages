"This design allows only one reader for E<.Pa /dev/devctl>.  This is not "
"desirable in the long run, but will get a lot of hair out of this "
"implementation.  Maybe we should make this device a clonable device."

"Also note: we specifically do not attach a device to the E<.Vt device_t> "

"of this belongs to the root node.  One could also further argue that the "
"E<.Xr sysctl 3> interface that we have now might more properly be an E<.Xr "
