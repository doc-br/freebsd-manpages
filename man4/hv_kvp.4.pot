"The E<.Nm> driver provides the ability to store, retrieve, modify and delete "
"key value pairs for E<.Fx> guest partitions running on Hyper-V.  Hyper-V "
"allows administrators to store custom metadata in the form of key value "
"pairs inside the E<.Fx> guest partition.  Administrators can use Windows "
"Powershell scripts to add, read, modify and delete such key value pairs."

"The driver is bare bones and merely forwards requests to its counterpart "
"user mode daemon, E<.Xr hv_kvp_daemon 8>.  The daemon maintains pools of key "
"value pairs and does the actual metadata management."

"The set functionality is particularly useful when the E<.Fx> guest is "
"assigned a static IP address and is failed over from one Hyper-V host to "
