"While audit trail files generated with E<.Xr audit 4> and maintained by "
"E<.Xr auditd 8> provide a reliable long-term store for audit log "
"information, current log files are owned by the audit daemon until "
"terminated making them somewhat unwieldy for live monitoring applications "
"such as host-based intrusion detection.  For example, the log may be cycled "
"and new records written to a new file without notice to applications that "
"may be accessing the file."

"The audit facility provides an audit pipe facility for applications "

"a E<.Qq tee> of the audit event stream.  As the device is clonable, more "
"than one instance of the device may be opened at a time; each device "

"an audit pipe queue fills, records will be dropped.  Audit pipe devices are "
