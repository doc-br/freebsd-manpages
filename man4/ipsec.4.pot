"E<.Nm> is a security protocol implemented within the Internet Protocol layer "
"of the networking stack.  E<.Nm> is defined for both IPv4 and IPv6 E<.Xr ( "
"inet 4> and E<.Xr inet6 4>).  E<.Nm> is a set of protocols, E<.Tn ESP> (for "
"Encapsulating Security Payload)  E<.Tn AH> (for Authentication Header), and "
"E<.Tn IPComp> (for IP Payload Compression Protocol)  that provide security "
"services for IP datagrams.  AH both authenticates and guarantees the "
"integrity of an IP packet by attaching a cryptographic checksum computed "
"using one-way hash functions.  ESP, in addition, prevents unauthorized "
"parties from reading the payload of an IP packet by also encrypting it.  "
"IPComp tries to increase communication performance by compressing IP "
"payload, thus reducing the amount of data sent.  This will help nodes on "
"slow links but with enough computing power.  E<.Nm> operates in one of two "
"modes: transport mode or tunnel mode.  Transport mode is used to protect "
"peer-to-peer communication between end nodes.  Tunnel mode encapsulates IP "
"packets within other IP packets and is designed for security gateways such "
"as VPN endpoints."
