"The E<.Nm> module keeps track of the locks acquired and released by each "
"thread.  It also keeps track of the order in which locks are acquired with "
"respect to each other.  Each time a lock is acquired, E<.Nm> uses these two "
"lists to verify that a lock is not being acquired in the wrong order.  If a "
"lock order violation is detected, then a message is output to the kernel "
"console or log detailing the locks involved and the locations in question.  "
"Witness can also be configured to drop into the kernel debugger when an "
"order violation occurs."

"The E<.Nm> code also checks various other conditions such as verifying that "
"one does not recurse on a non-recursive lock, or attempt an upgrade on a "
"shared lock held by another thread.  If any of these checks fail, then the "

"E<.Xr loader 8> via the E<.Va debug.witness.kdb> environment variable or "
