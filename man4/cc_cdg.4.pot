msgid ""
"CAIA-Delay Gradient (CDG) is a hybrid congestion control algorithm which "
"reacts to both packet loss and inferred queuing delay.  It attempts to "
"operate as a delay-based algorithm where possible, but utilises heuristics "
"to detect loss-based TCP cross traffic and will compete effectively as "
"required.  CDG is therefore incrementally deployable and suitable for use on "
"shared networks."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man4/cc_cdg.4:49
msgid ""
"During delay-based operation, CDG uses a delay-gradient based probabilistic "
"backoff mechanism, and will also try to infer non congestion related packet "
"losses and avoid backing off when they occur.  During loss-based operation, "
"CDG essentially reverts to E<.Xr cc_newreno 4 Ns - Ns like> behaviour."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"CDG switches to loss-based operation when it detects that a configurable "
"number of consecutive delay-based backoffs have had no measurable effect.  "
"It periodically attempts to return to delay-based operation, but will keep "
"switching back to loss-based operation as required."
