"E<.Xr fdt_pinctrl 4> provides an API for manipulating I/O pin configurations "
"on pinmux controllers and pinmux clients.  On the controller side, the "
"standard newbus probe and attach methods are implemented.  As part of "
"handling attach, it calls the E<.Fn fdt_pinctrl_register> function to "
"register itself as a pinmux controller.  Then E<.Fn "
"fdt_pinctrl_configure_tree> is used to walk the device tree and configure "
"pins specified by the pinctrl-0 property for all active devices.  The driver "
"also implements the E<.Fn fdt_pinctrl_configure> method, which allows client "
"devices to change their pin configurations after startup.  If a client "
"device requires a pin configuration change at some point of its lifecycle, "
"it uses the E<.Fn fdt_pinctrl_configure> or E<.Fn "
"fdt_pinctrl_configure_by_name> functions."
