"As of E<.Fx 5.0>, the E<.Vt ucred> structure contains extensible fields.  "

"E<.Fn crcopysafe>."

"In the common case, credentials required for access control decisions are "
"used in a read-only manner.  In these circumstances, the thread credential "
"E<.Va td_ucred> should be used, as it requires no locking to access safely, "
"and remains stable for the duration of the call even in the face of a "
"multi-threaded application changing the process credentials from another "
"thread."

"During a process credential update, the process lock must be held across "
"check and update, to prevent race conditions.  The process credential, E<.Va "
"td-E<gt>td_proc-E<gt>p_ucred>, must be used both for check and update.  If a "
"process credential is updated during a system call and checks against the "
"thread credential are to be made later during the same system call, the "
"thread credential must also be refreshed from the process credential so as "
"to prevent use of a stale value.  To avoid this scenario, it is recommended "
"that system calls updating the process credential be designed to avoid other "
"authorization functions."
