"The E<.Nm net80211> software layer provides a support framework for drivers "

"Drivers define a device's capabilities and can intercept and control "
"regulatory changes requested through E<.Nm net80211>.  The initial "
"regulatory state, including the channel list, must be filled in by the "
"driver before calling E<.Fn ieee80211_ifattach>.  The channel list should "
"reflect the set of channels the device is E<.Em calibrated> for use on.  "
"This list may also be requested later through the E<.Vt ic_getradiocaps> "
"method in the E<.Vt ieee80211com> structure.  The E<.Fn "
"ieee80211_init_channels> function is provided as a rudimentary fallback for "
"drivers that do not (or cannot) fill in a proper channel list.  Default "
"regulatory state is supplied such as the regulatory SKU, ISO country code, "
"location (e.g. indoor, outdoor), and a set of frequency bands the device is "
"capable of operating on.  E<.Nm net80211> populates the channel table in "
"E<.Vt ic_channels> with a default set of channels and capabilities.  Note "
"this mechanism should be used with care as any mismatch between the channel "
"list created and the device's capabilities can result in runtime errors "
"(e.g. a request to operate on a channel the device does not support).  The "
"SKU and country information are used for generating 802.11h protocol "
"elements and related operation such as for 802.11d; mis-setup by a driver is "
"not fatal, only potentially confusing."

"Drivers can control regulatory change requests by overriding the E<.Vt "
"ic_setregdomain> method that checks change requests.  While drivers can "
"reject any request that does not meet its requirements it is recommended "
"that one be lenient in what is accepted and, whenever possible, instead of "
"rejecting a request, alter it to be correct.  For example, if the transmit "
"power cap for a channel is too high the driver can either reject the request "
"or (better) reduce the cap to be compliant.  Requests that include "
"unacceptable channels should cause the request to be rejected as otherwise a "
"mismatch may be created between application state and the state managed by "
"E<.Nm net80211>.  The exact rules by which to operate are still being "
