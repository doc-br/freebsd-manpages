"A device driver may register a listener that will be notified each time a "
"name lookup on the E<.Xr devfs 5> mount point fails to find the vnode.  A "
"listener shall be registered for the E<.Va dev_clone> event.  When called, "
"it is supplied with the first argument E<.Va arg> that was specified at "
"handler registration time, appropriate credentials E<.Va cr>, and a name "
"E<.Va name> of length E<.Va namelen> that we look for.  If the handler "
"decides that the name is appropriate and wants to create the device that "
"will be associated with the name, it should return it to devfs in the E<.Va "
"dev> argument."
