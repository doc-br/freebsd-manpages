"Each device has a quiet flag associated with it.  A device is verbose by "
"default when it is created but may be quieted to prevent printing of the "
"device identification string during attach and printing of a message during "
"detach.  To quiet a device, call E<.Fn device_quiet> during a device driver "
"probe routine.  To re-enable probe messages, call E<.Fn device_verbose>.  To "
"test to see if a device is quieted, call E<.Fn device_is_quiet>."
