"The E<.Fn vm_page_dontneed> function advises the VM system that the given "
"page is no longer required.  If the page is already in the inactive queue or "
"in the cache queue, this function does nothing; otherwise the page is "
"deactivated."

"Note that E<.Fn vm_page_dontneed> does not necessarily deactivate a page, "
"but instead implements an algorithm that attempts to prevent small objects "
"from having their pages reused too quickly, and large objects from flushing "
"smaller ones from the queues as their pages are released."
