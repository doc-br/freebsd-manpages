"The E<.Fn vm_page_rename> function removes a page from one object, and adds "
"it to another at the given page index.  The page is added to the given "
"object, and is removed from the object that is currently associated with.  "
"If the page is currently on the cache queue it will be deactivated unless it "
"is wired or unmanaged, in which case the deactivation will fail.  The entire "
"page is marked as dirty after the move."
