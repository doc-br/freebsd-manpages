"E<.Nm> is a framework for drivers of cryptographic hardware to register with "
"the kernel so E<.Dq consumers> (other kernel subsystems, and users through "
"the E<.Pa /dev/crypto> device) are able to make use of it.  Drivers register "
"with the framework the algorithms they support, and provide entry points "
"(functions) the framework may call to establish, use, and tear down "
"sessions.  Sessions are used to cache cryptographic information in a "
"particular driver (or associated hardware), so initialization is not needed "
"with every request.  Consumers of cryptographic services pass a set of "
"descriptors that instruct the framework (and the drivers registered with it) "
"of the operations that should be applied on the data (more than one "
"cryptographic operation can be requested)."

"Since the consumers may not be associated with a process, drivers may not "
"E<.Xr sleep 9>.  The same holds for the framework.  Thus, a callback "
"mechanism is used to notify a consumer that a request has been completed "
"(the callback is specified by the consumer on a per-request basis).  The "
"callback is invoked by the framework whether the request was successfully "
"completed or not.  An error indication is provided in the latter case.  A "
"specific error code, E<.Er EAGAIN>, is used to indicate that a session "
"handle has changed and that the request may be re-submitted immediately with "
"the new session.  Errors are only returned to the invoking function if not "
"enough information to call the callback is available (meaning, there was a "
"fatal error in verifying the arguments).  For session initialization and "
"teardown no callback mechanism is used."
