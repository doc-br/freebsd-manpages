"The current state of a device is accessed by calling E<.Fn device_get_state> "
"which returns E<.Dv DS_NOTPRESENT>, E<.Dv DS_ALIVE>, E<.Dv DS_ATTACHED> or "
"E<.Dv DS_BUSY> (described in E<.Xr device 9>).  To test see if a device was "
"successfully probed, call E<.Fn device_is_alive> which simply returns if the "
"state is greater or equal to E<.Dv DS_ALIVE>.  To test see if a device was "
"successfully attached, call E<.Fn device_is_attached> which simply returns "
"if the state is greater or equal to E<.Dv DS_ATTACHED>."

"Each device has a busy count which is incremented when E<.Fn device_busy> is "
