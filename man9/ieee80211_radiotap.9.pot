"The E<.Nm net80211> layer used by 802.11 drivers includes support for a "
"device-independent packet capture format called E<.Nm radiotap> that is "
"understood by tools such as E<.Xr tcpdump 1>.  This facility is designed for "
"capturing 802.11 traffic, including information that is not part of the "
"normal 802.11 frame structure."

"Radiotap was designed to balance the desire for a hardware-independent, "
"extensible capture format against the need to conserve CPU and memory "
"bandwidth on embedded systems.  These considerations led to a format "
"consisting of a standard preamble followed by an extensible bitmap "
"indicating the presence of optional capture fields.  A E<.Nm net80211> "
"device driver supporting E<.Vt radiotap> defines two packed structures that "
"it shares with E<.Nm net80211>.  These structures embed an instance of a "
"E<.Vt ieee80211_radiotap_header> structure at the beginning, with subsequent "
"fields in the appropriate order, and macros to set the bits of the E<.Va "
"it_present> bitmap to indicate which fields exist and are filled in by the "
"driver.  This information is then supplied through the E<.Fn "
"ieee80211_radiotap_attach> call after a successful E<.Fn ieee80211_ifattach> "
