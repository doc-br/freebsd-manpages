"The utility of E<.Nm> is such that a server will not have to context switch "
"several times before performing the initial parsing of the request.  This "
"effectively reduces the amount of required CPU utilization to handle "
"incoming requests by keeping active processes in preforking servers such as "
"Apache low and reducing the size of the file descriptor set that needs to be "
"managed by interfaces such as E<.Fn select>, E<.Fn poll> or E<.Fn kevent> "
"based servers."
