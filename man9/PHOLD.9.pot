"If a process with a non-zero hold count attempts to exit, it will sleep "
"until its hold count has reached zero before the kernel begins releasing "
"resources associated with the process.  Once a process has started exiting, "
"it is invalid to increase its hold count.  Thus, callers must not attempt to "
"hold a process that has the E<.Dv P_WEXIT> flag set.  The VM daemon will not "
"swap out the kernel stack of a thread belonging to a process with a non-zero "
"hold count."
