"This call implements the logic for the E<.Ux> discretionary file security "
"model common to many file systems in E<.Fx>.  It accepts the vnodes type "
"E<.Fa type>, permissions via E<.Fa file_mode>, owning UID E<.Fa file_uid>, "
"owning GID E<.Fa file_gid>, desired access mode E<.Fa accmode>, requesting "
"credential E<.Fa cred>, and an optional call-by-reference E<.Vt int> pointer "
"returning whether or not privilege was required for successful evaluation of "
"the call; the E<.Fa privused> pointer may be set to E<.Dv NULL> by the "
"caller in order not to be informed of privilege information, or it may point "
"to an integer that will be set to 1 if privilege is used, and 0 otherwise."
