"The E<.Fn BUS_RESCAN> method is called to request a rescan of the child "
"devices on a bus device.  The method should add any devices that have been "
"added since the previous scan and remove devices that have been removed.  "
"This method is not required to re-examine existing devices to determine if "
"their properties have changed.  This method is also not required to "
"propagate the rescan request to child devices."
