"Each driver in the kernel is described by a E<.Dv driver_t> structure.  The "
"structure contains the name of the device, a pointer to a list of methods, "
"an indication of the kind of device which the driver implements and the size "
"of the private data which the driver needs to associate with a device "
"instance.  Each driver will implement one or more sets of methods (called "
"interfaces).  The example driver implements the standard \"driver\" "
"interface and the fictitious \"bogo\" interface."

"When a driver is registered with the system (by the E<.Dv DRIVER_MODULE> "
"macro, see E<.Xr DRIVER_MODULE 9>), it is added to the list of drivers "
"contained in the devclass of its parent bus type.  For instance all PCI "
"drivers would be contained in the devclass named \"pci\" and all ISA drivers "
"would be in the devclass named \"isa\".  The reason the drivers are not held "
"in the device object of the parent bus is to handle multiple instances of a "
"given type of bus.  The E<.Dv DRIVER_MODULE> macro will also create the "
"devclass with the name of the driver and can optionally call extra "
"initialisation code in the driver by specifying an extra module event "
"handler and argument as the last two arguments."
