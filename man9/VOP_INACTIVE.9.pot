"E<.Fn VOP_INACTIVE> is usually called when the kernel is no longer using the "
"vnode.  However, there is no guarantee that it will be called at all, for "
"example if the last reference was dropped while the vnode lock could not be "
"upgraded to exclusive without sleeping.  This may be because the reference "
"count reaches zero or it may be that the file system is being forcibly "
"unmounted while there are open files.  It can be used to reclaim space on "
"the last close of an E<.Sq open but deleted> file."
