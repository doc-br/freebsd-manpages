"The E<.Nm net80211> layer that supports 802.11 device drivers requires that "
"receive processing be single-threaded.  Typically this is done using a "
"dedicated driver E<.Xr taskqueue 9> thread.  E<.Fn ieee80211_input> and "
"E<.Fn ieee80211_input_all> process received 802.11 frames and are designed "
"for use in that context; e.g. no driver locks may be held."

"The frame passed up in the E<.Vt mbuf> must have the 802.11 protocol header "
"at the front; all device-specific information and/or PLCP must be removed.  "
"Any CRC must be stripped from the end of the frame.  The 802.11 protocol "
"header should be 32-bit aligned for optimal performance but receive "
"processing does not require it.  If the frame holds a payload and that is "
"not aligned to a 32-bit boundary then the payload will be re-aligned so that "
"it is suitable for processing by protocols such as E<.Xr ip 4>."

"a Block ACK stream is active, not just A-MPDU aggregates.  It is sufficient "

"The E<.Vt rssi> parameter is the Receive Signal Strength Indication of the "
"frame measured in 0.5dBm units relative to the noise floor.  The E<.Vt "
"noise> parameter is the best approximation of the noise floor in dBm units "
"at the time the frame was received.  RSSI and noise are used by the E<.Nm "
"net80211> layer to make scanning and roaming decisions in station mode and "
"to do auto channel selection for hostap and similar modes.  Otherwise the "
"values are made available to user applications (with the rssi presented as a "
"filtered average over the last ten values and the noise floor the last "
"reported value)."
