"The E<.Nm> interfaces check to see if specific system privileges are granted "
"to the passed thread, E<.Fa td>, or credential, E<.Fa cred>.  This interface "
"replaces the now removed E<.Xr suser 9> privilege checking interface.  "
"Privileges typically represent rights in one of two categories: the right to "
"manage a particular component of the system, or an exemption to a specific "
"policy or access control list.  The caller identifies the desired privilege "
"via the E<.Fa priv> argument."

"Privileges are typically granted based on one of two base system policies: "
"the superuser policy, which grants privilege based on the effective (or "
"sometimes real) UID having a value of 0, and the E<.Xr jail 2> policy, which "
"permits only certain privileges to be granted to processes in a jail.  The "
"set of available privileges may also be influenced by the TrustedBSD MAC "
"Framework, described in E<.Xr mac 9>."

"When adding a new privilege check to a code path, first check the complete "
"list of current privileges in E<.Pa sys/priv.h> to see if one already exists "
"for the class of privilege required.  Only if there is not an exact match "
"should a new privilege be added to the privilege list.  As privilege numbers "
"becomes encoded in the kernel module ABI, privilege constants must not be "
"changed as any kernel modules depending on privileges will then need to be "
"recompiled.  When adding a new privilege, be certain to also determine "
"whether it should be listed in E<.Fn prison_priv_check>, which includes a "
"complete list of privileges granted to the root user in E<.Xr jail 2>."

"When designing new APIs, it is preferable to return explicit errors from a "
"call if privilege is not granted rather than changing the semantics of the "
"call but returning success.  For example, the behavior exhibited by E<.Xr "
"stat 2>, in which the generation field is optionally zero'd out when there "
"is insufficient privilege is highly undesirable, as it results in frequent "
"privilege checks, and the caller is unable to tell if an access control "
"failure occurred."
