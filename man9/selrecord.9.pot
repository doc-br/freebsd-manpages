"E<.Fn seldrain>, E<.Fn selrecord> and E<.Fn selwakeup> are the three central "
"functions used by E<.Xr select 2>, E<.Xr poll 2> and the objects that are "
"being selected on.  They handle the task of recording which threads are "
"waiting on which objects and the waking of the proper threads when an event "
"of interest occurs on an object."

"E<.Fn selrecord> records that the calling thread is interested in events "
"related to a given object.  If another thread is already waiting on the "
"object a collision will be flagged in E<.Fa sip> which will be later dealt "
"with by E<.Fn selwakeup>."

"E<.Fn selwakeup> is called by the underlying object handling code in order "
"to notify any waiting threads that an event of interest has occurred.  If a "
"collision has occurred, E<.Fn selwakeup> will increment E<.Va nselcoll>, and "
"broadcast on the global cv in order to wake all waiting threads so that they "
"can handle it.  If the thread waiting on the object is not currently "
"sleeping or the wait channel is not E<.Va selwait>, E<.Fn selwakeup> will "
"clear the E<.Dv TDF_SELECT> flag which should be noted by E<.Xr select 2> "
"and E<.Xr poll 2> when they wake up."

"The contents of E<.Fa *sip> must be zeroed, such as by softc initialization, "
"before any call to E<.Fn selrecord> or E<.Fn selwakeup>, otherwise a panic "
"may occur.  E<.Fn selwakeup> acquires and releases E<.Va sellock> and may "
"acquire and release E<.Va sched_lock>.  E<.Fn seldrain> could usually be "
"just a wrapper for E<.Fn selwakeup>, but consumers should not generally rely "
"on this feature."
