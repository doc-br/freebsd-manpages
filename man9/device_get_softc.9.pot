"Return the driver-specific software context of E<.Fa dev>.  The softc is "
"automatically allocated and zeroed when the device is attached.  The softc "
"is also initialized and present when a device is probed, but is subject to "
"caveats as described in E<.Xr DEVICE_PROBE 9>.  The size of the allocation "
"is determined by the device's E<.Vt driver_t> information used to define the "
"driver.  The softc typically encapsulates the state of this instance of the "
