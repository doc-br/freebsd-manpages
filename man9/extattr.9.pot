"Named extended attributes allow additional meta-data to be associated with "
"vnodes representing files and directories.  The semantics of this additional "
"data is that of a \"name=value\" pair, where a name may be defined or "
"undefined, and if defined, associated with zero or more bytes of arbitrary "
"binary data.  Extended attribute names exist within a set of namespaces; "
"each operation on an extended attribute is required to provide the namespace "
"to which to operation refers.  If the same name is present in multiple "
"namespaces, the extended attributes associated with the names are stored and "
"manipulated independently.  The following two namespaces are defined "
"universally, although individual file systems may implement additional "
"namespaces, or not implement these namespaces: E<.Dv "
"EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_USER>, E<.Dv EXTATTR_NAMESPACE_SYSTEM>.  The semantics of "
"these attributes are intended to be as follows: user attribute data is "
"protected according the normal discretionary and mandatory protections "
"associated with the data in the file or directory; system attribute data is "
"protected such that appropriate privilege is required to directly access or "
"manipulate these attributes."

"Reads of extended attribute data may return specific contiguous regions of "
"the meta-data, in the style of E<.Xr VOP_READ 9>, but writes will replace "
"the entire current \"value\" associated with a given name.  As there are a "
"plethora of file systems with differing extended attributes, availability "
"and functionality of these functions may be limited, and they should be used "
"with awareness of the underlying semantics of the supporting file system.  "
"Authorization schemes for extended attribute data may also vary by file "
"system, as well as maximum attribute size, and whether or not any or "
"specific new attributes may be defined."
