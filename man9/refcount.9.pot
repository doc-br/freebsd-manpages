msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> functions provide an API to manage a simple reference counter.  "
"The caller provides the storage for the counter in an unsigned integer.  A "
"pointer to this integer is passed via E<.Fa count>.  Usually the counter is "
"used to manage the lifetime of an object and is stored as a member of the "
"object."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man9/refcount.9:62
msgid ""
"The E<.Fn refcount_init> function is used to set the initial value of the "
"counter to E<.Fa value>.  It is normally used when creating a "
"reference-counted object."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man9/refcount.9:72
msgid ""
"The E<.Fn refcount_acquire> function is used to acquire a new reference.  "
"The caller is responsible for ensuring that it holds a valid reference while "
"obtaining a new reference.  For example, if an object is stored on a list "
"and the list holds a reference on the object, then holding a lock that "
"protects the list provides sufficient protection for acquiring a new "
"reference."

"The E<.Fn refcount_release> function is used to release an existing "
"reference.  The function returns a non-zero value if the reference being "
"released was the last reference; otherwise, it returns zero."

"Note that these routines do not provide any inter-CPU synchronization, data "
"protection, or memory ordering guarantees except for managing the counter.  "
"The caller is responsible for any additional synchronization needed by "
"consumers of any containing objects.  In addition, the caller is also "
"responsible for managing the life cycle of any containing objects including "
"explicitly releasing any resources when the last reference is released."
