"This call implements the logic for the E<.Ux> discretionary file security "
"model with NFSv4 ACL extensions.  It accepts the vnodes type E<.Fa type>, "
"owning UID E<.Fa file_uid>, owning GID E<.Fa file_gid>, access ACL for the "
"file E<.Fa acl>, desired access mode E<.Fa accmode>, requesting credential "
"E<.Fa cred>, and an optional call-by-reference E<.Vt int> pointer returning "
"whether or not privilege was required for successful evaluation of the call; "
"the E<.Fa privused> pointer may be set to E<.Dv NULL> by the caller in order "
"not to be informed of privilege information, or it may point to an integer "
"that will be set to 1 if privilege is used, and 0 otherwise."
