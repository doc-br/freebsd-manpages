"CDROM type commands.  Some drives do not behave as the driver expects.  See "

"This flag tells the driver that the given device only accepts 10 byte MODE "
"SENSE/MODE SELECT commands.  In general these types of quirks should not be "
"added to the E<.Xr cd 4> driver.  The reason is that the driver does several "
"things to attempt to determine whether the drive in question needs 10 byte "
"commands.  First, it issues a CAM Path Inquiry command to determine whether "
"the protocol that the drive speaks typically only allows 10 byte commands.  "
"(ATAPI and USB are two prominent examples of protocols where you generally "
"only want to send 10 byte commands.)  Then, if it gets an ILLEGAL REQUEST "
"error back from a 6 byte MODE SENSE or MODE SELECT command, it attempts to "
"send the 10 byte version of the command instead.  The only reason you would "
"need a quirk is if your drive uses a protocol (e.g., E<.Tn SCSI>)  that "
"typically does not have a problem with 6 byte commands."
