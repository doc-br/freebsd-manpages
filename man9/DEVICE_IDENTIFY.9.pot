"The identify function for a device is only needed for devices on buses that "
"cannot identify their children independently, e.g.\\& the ISA bus.  It is "
"used to recognize the device (usually done by accessing non-ambiguous "
"registers in the hardware) and to tell the kernel about it and thus creating "
"a new device instance."

"E<.Xr BUS_ADD_CHILD 9> is used to register the device as a child of the "
"bus.  The device's resources (such as IRQ and I/O ports) are registered with "
"the kernel by calling E<.Fn bus_set_resource> for each resource (refer to "
"E<.Xr bus_set_resource 9> for more information)."

"Since the device tree and the device driver tree are disjoint, the E<.Fn "
"DEVICE_IDENTIFY> routine needs to take this into account.  If you load and "
"unload your device driver that has the identify routine, the child node has "
"the potential for adding the same node multiple times unless specific "
"measure are taken to preclude that possibility."
