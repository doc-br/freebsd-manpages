"Create a new child device of E<.Fa dev>.  The E<.Fa name> and E<.Fa unit> "
"arguments specify the name and unit number of the device.  If the name is "
"unknown then the caller should pass E<.Dv NULL>.  If the unit is unknown "
"then the caller should pass E<.Dv -1> and the system will choose the next "
"available unit number."

"The name of the device is used to determine which drivers might be "
"appropriate for the device.  If a name is specified then only drivers of "
"that name are probed.  If no name is given then all drivers for the owning "
"bus are probed.  In any event, only the name of the device is stored so that "
"one may safely unload/load a driver bound to that name."

"This allows buses which can uniquely identify device instances (such as PCI) "
"to allow each driver to check each device instance for a match.  For buses "
"which rely on supplied probe hints where only one driver can have a chance "

"name."

"(e.g.,\\& for wiring a particular piece of hardware to a pre-configured unit "
"number), that unit should be passed.  If the specified unit number is "

"If the devices attached to a bus must be probed in a specific order "
"(e.g.,\\& for the ISA bus some devices are sensitive to failed probe "
"attempts of unrelated drivers and therefore must be probed first), the E<.Fa "

"a partial ordering.  The new device will be added before any existing device "
"with a greater order.  If E<.Fn device_add_child> is used, then the new "
"child will be added as if its order was zero."

"When adding a device in the context of E<.Xr DEVICE_IDENTIFY 9> routine, the "

"devclass_t> are associated at probe time (not child addition time), previous "
"instances of the driver (say in a module that was later unloaded) may have "
