"The E<.Fn vn_fullpath> function makes a E<.Dq \"best effort\"> attempt to "
"generate a string pathname for the passed vnode; the resulting path, if any, "
"will be relative to the root directory of the process associated with the "
"passed thread pointer.  The E<.Fn vn_fullpath> function is implemented by "
"inspecting the VFS name cache, and attempting to reconstruct a path from the "
"process root to the object."

"This process is necessarily unreliable for several reasons: intermediate "
"entries in the path may not be found in the cache; files may have more than "
"one name (hard links), not all file systems use the name cache "
"(specifically, most synthetic file systems do not); a single name may be "
"used for more than one file (in the context of file systems covering other "
"file systems); a file may have no name (if deleted but still open or "
"referenced).  However, the resulting string may still be more useable to a "
"user than a vnode pointer value, or a device number and inode number.  Code "
"consuming the results of this function should anticipate (and properly "
"handle) failure."
