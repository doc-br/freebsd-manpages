"The E<.Fn DEVICE_PROBE> method should probe to see if the device is "
"present.  It should return 0 if the device exists, E<.Er ENXIO> if it cannot "
"be found.  If some other error happens during the probe (such as a memory "
"allocation failure), an appropriate error code should be returned.  For "
"cases where more than one driver matches a device, a priority value can be "
"returned.  In this case, success codes are values less than or equal to zero "
"with the highest value representing the best match.  Failure codes are "
"represented by positive values and the regular E<.Ux> error codes should be "
"used for the purpose."

"probe must be released and re-allocated if the attach method is called.  In "
"addition it is an absolute requirement that the probe routine have no side "
"effects whatsoever.  The probe routine may be called more than once before "
"the attach routine is called."
