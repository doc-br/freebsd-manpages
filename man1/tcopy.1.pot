"The E<.Nm> utility is designed to copy magnetic tapes.  The only assumption "
"made about the tape layout is that there are two sequential EOF marks at the "
"end.  By default, the E<.Nm> utility will print information about the sizes "
"of records and files found on the E<.Pa /dev/sa0> tape, or on the tape "
"specified by the E<.Ar src> argument.  If a destination tape is also "
"specified by the E<.Ar dest> argument, a copy of the source tape will be "
"made.  The blocking on the destination tape will be identical to that used "
"on the source tape.  Copying a tape will yield the same program output as if "
"just printing the sizes."
