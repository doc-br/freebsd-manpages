"The E<.Nm> utility will ask the user (on E<.Pa /dev/tty>)  to insert a new "
"floppy and press return.  The device will then be opened, and queried for "
"its parameters, then each track will be formatted, written with data from "
"the E<.Ar inputfile>, read back and compared.  When the floppy disk is "
"filled, the process is repeated, with the next disk.  This continues until "
"the program is interrupted or EOF is encountered on the E<.Ar inputfile>."
