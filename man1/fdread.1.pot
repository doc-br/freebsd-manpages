"The E<.Nm> utility reads floppy disks.  Effective read blocking based on the "
"track size is performed, and floppy-specific error recovery of otherwise bad "
"blocks can be enabled."

"The E<.Nm> utility will always read an entire floppy medium, and write its "
"contents to the respective output file.  Unlike other tools like E<.Xr dd "
"1>, E<.Nm> automatically uses a read block size that is more efficient than "
"reading single blocks (usually one track of data at a time), but falls back "
"to reading single floppy sectors in case of an input/output error occurred, "
"in order to obtain as much valid data as possible.  While E<.Nm> is working, "
"kernel error reporting for floppy errors is turned off, so the console "
"and/or syslog are not flooded with kernel error messages."
