"The E<.Nm> utility, also known as E<.Nm crypt> is a E<.Em very> simple "
"encryption program, working on a E<.Dq secret-key> basis.  It operates as a "
"filter, i.e., it encrypts or decrypts a stream of data from standard input, "
"and writes the result to standard output.  Since its operation is fully "
"symmetrical, feeding the encrypted data stream again through the engine "
"(using the same secret key) will decrypt it."

"There are several ways to provide the secret key to the program.  By "
"default, the program prompts the user on the controlling terminal for the "
"key, using E<.Xr getpass 3>.  This is the only safe way of providing it."

"Alternatively, the key can be provided as the sole command-line argument "
"E<.Ar password> when starting the program.  Obviously, this way the key can "
"easily be spotted by other users running E<.Xr ps 1>.  As yet another "
"alternative, E<.Nm> can be given the option E<.Fl k>, and it will take the "
"key from the environment variable E<.Ev CrYpTkEy>.  While this at a first "
"glance seems to be more secure than the previous option, it actually is not "
"since environment variables can also be examined with E<.Xr ps 1>.  Thus "
"this option is mainly provided for compatibility with other implementations "
"of E<.Nm>."
