"The E<.Nm> utility is a line-oriented text editor.  It is used to create, "
"display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files.  When invoked as E<.Nm "
"red>, the editor runs in E<.Qq restricted> mode, in which the only "
"difference is that the editor restricts the use of filenames which start "
"with E<.Ql \\&!> (interpreted as shell commands by E<.Nm>)  or contain a "
"E<.Ql \\&/>.  Note that editing outside of the current directory is only "
"prohibited if the user does not have write access to the current directory.  "
"If a user has write access to the current directory, then symbolic links can "
"be created in the current directory, in which case E<.Nm red> will not stop "
"the user from editing the file that the symbolic link points to."
