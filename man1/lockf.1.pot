"The E<.Nm> utility acquires an exclusive lock on a E<.Ar file>, creating it "
"if necessary, E<.Bf Em> and removing the file on exit unless explicitly told "
"not to.  E<.Ef> While holding the lock, it executes a E<.Ar command> with "
"optional E<.Ar arguments>.  After the E<.Ar command> completes, E<.Nm> "
"releases the lock, and removes the E<.Ar file> unless the E<.Fl k> option is "
"specified.  E<.Bx Ns -style> locking is used, as described in E<.Xr flock "

"If the E<.Nm> utility is being used to facilitate concurrency between a "

"unlink, drop and re-acquire activity.  It should be noted that if the E<.Fl "
"k> option is not used, then no guarantees around lock ordering can be made."
