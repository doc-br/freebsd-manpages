"The E<.Nm> utility is the standard command interpreter for the system.  The "

"Berkeley extensions.  This man page is not intended to be a tutorial nor a "

"The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, "
"interprets them, and generally executes other commands.  It is the program "
"that is started when a user logs into the system, although a user can select "
"a different shell with the E<.Xr chsh 1> command.  The shell implements a "
"language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility that provides a "
"variety of features in addition to data storage, along with built-in history "
"and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features to aid "
"interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is "
"common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).  That "
"is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a "
"file, which can be executed directly by the shell."

"If no arguments are present and if the standard input of the shell is "
"connected to a terminal (or if the E<.Fl i> option is set), the shell is "
"considered an interactive shell.  An interactive shell generally prompts "
"before each command and handles programming and command errors differently "
"(as described below).  When first starting, the shell inspects argument 0, "
"and if it begins with a dash E<.Pq Ql ->, the shell is also considered a "
"login shell.  This is normally done automatically by the system when the "
"user first logs in.  A login shell first reads commands from the files E<.Pa "
"/etc/profile> and then E<.Pa .profile> in a user's home directory, if they "
"exist.  If the environment variable E<.Ev ENV> is set on entry to a shell, "
"or is set in the E<.Pa .profile> of a login shell, the shell then subjects "
"its value to parameter expansion and arithmetic expansion and reads commands "
"from the named file.  Therefore, a user should place commands that are to be "
"executed only at login time in the E<.Pa .profile> file, and commands that "
"are executed for every shell inside the E<.Ev ENV> file.  The user can set "
"the E<.Ev ENV> variable to some file by placing the following line in the "
"file E<.Pa .profile> in the home directory, substituting for E<.Pa .shrc> "
"the filename desired:"
