"B<zstd> is a fast lossless compression algorithm and data compression tool, "
"with command line syntax similar to B<gzip (1)> and B<xz (1)>. It is based "
"on the B<LZ77> family, with further FSE & huff0 entropy stages. B<zstd> "
"offers highly configurable compression speed, with fast modes at E<gt> 200 "
"MB/s per core, and strong modes nearing lzma compression ratios. It also "
"features a very fast decoder, with speeds E<gt> 500 MB/s per core."
