"Subversion is a version control system, which allows you to keep old "
"versions of files and directories (usually source code), keep a log of who, "
"when, and why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  B<Subversion> "
"keeps a single copy of the master sources.  This copy is called the source "
"``repository''; it contains all the information to permit extracting "
"previous versions of those files at any time."
