"Audit record preselection occurs with respect to the audit identifier "
"associated with a process, rather than with respect to the UNIX user or "
"group ID.  The audit identifier is set as part of the user credential "
"context as part of login, and typically does not change as a result of "
"running setuid or setgid applications, such as E<.Xr su 1>.  This has the "
"advantage that events that occur after running E<.Xr su 1> can be audited to "
"the original authenticated user, as required by CAPP, but may be surprising "
"if not expected."
