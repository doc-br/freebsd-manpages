"The file E<.Nm> contains information that is used by various routines to "
"initialize and control the use of terminal special files.  Pseudo-terminals "
"(see E<.Xr pts 4>)  are not listed.  This information is read with the E<.Xr "
"getttyent 3> library routines.  There is one line in the E<.Nm> file per "
"special device file.  Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces.  Fields "
"comprised of more than one word should be enclosed in double quotes "
"(``\"'').  Blank lines and comments may appear anywhere in the file; "
"comments are delimited by hash marks (``#'') and new lines.  Any unspecified "
"fields will default to null."

"associated command is not related to a tty."

"The second field of the file is the command to execute for the line, usually "
"E<.Xr getty 8>, which initializes and opens the line, setting the speed, "
"waiting for a user name and executing the E<.Xr login 1> program.  It can "
"be, however, any desired command, for example the start up for a window "
"system terminal emulator or some other daemon process, and can contain "
"multiple words if quoted."

"(whether dialin, network or otherwise), or specify a tty group name that "

"As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that E<.Xr init 8> "
"should (should not) execute the command given in the second field.  "
"``onifconsole'' will cause this line to be enabled if and only if it is an "
"active kernel console device (it is equivalent to ``on'' in this case).  The "
"flag ``onifexists'' will cause this line to be enabled if and only if the "
"name exists.  If the name starts with a ``/'', it will be considered an "
"absolute path.  Otherwise, it is considered a path relative to E<.Pa /dev>.  "
"The flag ``secure'' (if the console is enabled) allows users with a uid of 0 "
"to login on this line.  The flag ``dialin'' indicates that a tty entry "
"describes a dialin line, and ``network'' is obsolete and does nothing.  "
"Either of these strings may also be specified in the terminal type field.  "
"The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted command string which "
"E<.Xr init 8> will execute E<.Em before> starting the command specified by "
"the second field."
