"The portable bitmap format is a lowest common denominator monochrome file "
"format.  It was originally designed to make it reasonable to mail bitmaps "
"between different types of machines using the typical stupid network mailers "
"we have today.  Now it serves as the common language of a large family of "
"bitmap conversion filters.  The definition is as follows:"
