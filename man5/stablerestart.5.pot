"restart without always returning the NFSERR_NOGRACE error, as described in "

"The first record in the file, as defined by struct nfsf_rec in "

"Following this are the number of previous boot times listed in the first "
"record.  The lease duration is used to set the grace period.  The boot times "
"are used to avoid the unlikely occurrence of a boot time being reused, due "
"to a TOD clock going backwards. This record and the previous boot times with "
"this boot time added is re-written at the end of the grace period."

"records indicate that state information for a client was discarded, due to "
"lease expiry and an otherwise conflicting open or lock request being made by "
