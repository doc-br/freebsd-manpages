msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> driver implements an in-memory, or E<.Tn tmpfs> file system.  The "
"filesystem stores both file metadata and data in main memory.  This allows "
"very fast and low latency accesses to the data.  The data is volatile.  An "
"umount or system reboot invalidates it.  These properties make the "
"filesystem's mounts suitable for fast scratch storage, like E<.Pa /tmp>."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/share/man/man5/tmpfs.5:98
msgid ""
"If the system becomes low on memory and swap is configured (see E<.Xr swapon "
"8 ),> the system can transfer file data to swap space, freeing memory for "
"other needs.  Metadata, including the directory content, is never swapped "
"out by the current implementation.  Keep this in mind when planning the "
"mount limits, especially when expecting to place many small files on a tmpfs "
"mount."

#: /usr/src/share/man/man5/tmpfs.5:107
msgid ""
"When E<.Xr mmap 2> is used on a file from a tmpfs mount, the swap VM object "
"managing the file pages is used to implement mapping and avoid "
"double-copying of the file data.  This quirk causes process inspection "
"tools, like E<.Xr procstat 1>, to report anonymous memory mappings instead "
"of file mappings."
