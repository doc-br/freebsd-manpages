"The E<.Ar group> field is the group name used for granting file access to "
"users who are members of the group.  The E<.Ar gid> field is the number "
"associated with the group name.  They should both be unique across the "
"system (and often across a group of systems) since they control file "
"access.  The E<.Ar passwd> field is an optional E<.Em encrypted> password.  "
"This field is rarely used and an asterisk is normally placed in it rather "
"than leaving it blank.  The E<.Ar member> field contains the names of users "
"granted the privileges of E<.Ar group>.  The member names are separated by "
"commas without spaces or newlines.  A user is automatically in a group if "
"that group was specified in their E<.Pa /etc/passwd> entry and does not need "
"to be added to that group in the E<.Nm> file."
