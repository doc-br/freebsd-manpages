"The E<.Nm .forward> file contains a list of mail addresses or programs that "
"the user's mail should be redirected to.  If the file is not present, then "
"no mail forwarding will be done.  Mail may also be forwarded as the standard "
"input to a program by prefixing the line with the normal shell pipe symbol "
"(|).  If arguments are to be passed to the command, then the entire line "
"should be enclosed in quotes.  For security reasons, the E<.Nm .forward> "
"file must be owned by the user the mail is being sent to, or by root, and "
"the user's shell must be listed in E<.Pa /etc/shells>."
