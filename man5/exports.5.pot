"In a mount entry, the first field(s) specify the directory path(s) within a "
"server file system that can be mounted on by the corresponding client(s).  "
"There are three forms of this specification.  The first is to list all mount "
"points as absolute directory paths separated by whitespace.  This list of "
"directory paths should be considered an E<.Dq administrative control>, since "
"it is only enforced by the E<.Xr mountd 8> daemon and not the kernel.  As "
"such, it only applies to NFSv2 and NFSv3 mounts and only with respect to the "
"client's use of the mount protocol.  The second is to specify the pathname "
"of the root of the file system followed by the E<.Fl alldirs> flag; this "
"form allows the host(s) to mount at any point within the file system, "
"including regular files if the E<.Fl r> option is used on E<.Xr mountd 8>.  "
"Because NFSv4 does not use the mount protocol, the E<.Dq administrative "
"controls> are not applied and all directories within this server file system "
"are mountable via NFSv4 even if the E<.Fl alldirs> flag has not been "
"specified.  The third form has the string ``V4:'' followed by a single "
"absolute path name, to specify the NFSv4 tree root.  This line does not "
"export any file system, but simply marks where the root of the server's "
"directory tree is for NFSv4 clients.  The exported file systems for NFSv4 "
"are specified via the other lines in the E<.Nm> file in the same way as for "
"NFSv2 and NFSv3.  The pathnames must not have any symbolic links in them and "
"should not have any E<.Dq Pa \\&.> or E<.Dq Pa ..> components.  Mount points "
"for a file system may appear on multiple lines each with different sets of "
