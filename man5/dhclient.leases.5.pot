"The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client keeps a persistent database of "
"leases that it has acquired that are still valid.  The database is a "
"free-form ASCII file containing one valid declaration per lease.  If more "
"than one declaration appears for a given lease, the last one in the file is "
"used.  The file is written as a log, so this is not an unusual occurrence."
