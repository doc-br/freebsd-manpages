"The E<.Nm> file is the configuration file for the E<.Xr syslogd 8> program.  "
"It consists of blocks of lines separated by E<.Em program> and E<.Em "
"hostname> specifications (separations appear alone on their lines), with "
"each line containing two fields: the E<.Em selector> field which specifies "
"the types of messages and priorities to which the line applies, and an E<.Em "
"action> field which specifies the action to be taken if a message E<.Xr "
"syslogd 8> receives matches the selection criteria.  The E<.Em selector> "
"field is separated from the E<.Em action> field by one or more tab "
"characters or spaces."
