"E<.Nm> contains the information necessary to configure the TACACS+ client "
"library.  It is parsed by E<.Fn tac_config> (see E<.Xr libtacplus 3>).  The "
"file contains one or more lines of text, each describing a single TACACS+ "
"server which is to be used by the library.  Leading white space is ignored, "
"as are empty lines and lines containing only comments."

"A TACACS+ server is described by two to four fields on a line.  The fields "
"are separated by white space.  The E<.Ql #> character at the beginning of a "
"field begins a comment, which extends to the end of the line.  A field may "
"be enclosed in double quotes, in which case it may contain white space "
"and/or begin with the E<.Ql #> character.  Within a quoted string, the "
"double quote character can be represented by E<.Ql \\e\\&\">, and the "
"backslash can be represented by E<.Ql \\e\\e>.  No other escape sequences "
"are supported."

"The first field specifies the server host, either as a fully qualified "
"domain name or as a dotted-quad IP address.  The host may optionally be "
"followed by a E<.Ql \\&:> and a numeric port number, without intervening "
"white space.  If the port specification is omitted, it defaults to 49, the "
"standard TACACS+ port."

"The second field contains the shared secret, which should be known only to "

"though it must be enclosed in double quotes if it contains white space or is "
"empty.  An empty secret disables the normal encryption mechanism, causing "
"all data to cross the network in cleartext."
