"The file E<.Pa /etc/phones> contains the system-wide private phone numbers "
"for the E<.Xr tip 1> program.  This file is normally unreadable, and so may "
"contain privileged information.  The format of the file is a series of lines "
"of the form: E<lt>system-nameE<gt>[\\ \\et]*E<lt>phone-numberE<gt>.  The "
"system name is one of those defined in the E<.Xr remote 5> file and the "
"phone number is constructed from any sequence of characters terminated only "
"by ``,'' or the end of the line.  The ``='' and ``*'' characters are "
"indicators to the auto call units to pause and wait for a second dial tone "
"(when going through an exchange).  The ``='' is required by the E<.Tn "
"DF02-AC> and the ``*'' is required by the E<.Tn BIZCOMP> 1030."
