"If Unbound was built with B<--with-libhiredis> on a system that has "
"installed the hiredis C client library of Redis, then the \"redis\" backend "
"can be used.  This backend communicates with the specified Redis server over "
"a TCP connection to store and retrieve cache data.  It can be used as a "
"persistent and/or shared cache backend.  It should be noted that Unbound "
"never removes data stored in the Redis server, even if some data have "
"expired in terms of DNS TTL or the Redis server has cached too much data; if "
"necessary the Redis server must be configured to limit the cache size, "
"preferably with some kind of least-recently-used eviction policy.  This "
"backend uses synchronous communication with the Redis server based on the "
"assumption that the communication is stable and sufficiently fast.  The "
"thread waiting for a response from the Redis server cannot handle other DNS "
"queries.  Although the backend has the ability to reconnect to the server "
"when the connection is closed unexpectedly and there is a configurable "
"timeout in case the server is overly slow or hangs up, these cases are "
"assumed to be very rare.  If connection close or timeout happens too often, "
"Unbound will be effectively unusable with this backend.  It's the "
"administrator's responsibility to make the assumption hold."
