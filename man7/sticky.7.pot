"A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only directory, or, "
"more accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files is restricted.  "
"A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed by a user if the "
"user has write permission for the directory and the user is the owner of the "
"file, the owner of the directory, or the super-user.  This feature is "
"usefully applied to directories such as E<.Pa /tmp> which must be publicly "
"writable but should deny users the license to arbitrarily delete or rename "
"each others' files."
