"The E<.Fx> Test Suite provides a collection of automated tests for two major "
"purposes.  On one hand, the test suite aids E<.Em developers> to detect bugs "
"and regressions when they modify the source tree.  On the other hand, it "
"allows E<.Em end users> (and, in particular, system administrators) to "
"verify that fresh installations of the E<.Fx> operating system behave "
"correctly on their hardware platform and also to ensure that the system does "
"not suffer from regressions during regular operation and maintenance."
