"Hostnames are often used with network client and server programs, which must "

"If the name consists of a single component, i.e., contains no dot, and if "
"the environment variable E<.Dq Ev HOSTALIASES> is set to the name of a file, "

"should consist of lines made up of two white-space separated strings, the "
"first of which is the hostname alias, and the second of which is the "
"complete hostname to be substituted for that alias.  If a case-insensitive "
"match is found between the hostname to be resolved and the first field of a "

"If the input name does not end with a trailing dot, it is looked up by "

"CS.Berkeley.EDU, the name lithium.CChem will be checked first as "
"lithium.CChem.CS.Berkeley.EDU and then as lithium.CChem.Berkeley.EDU.  "
"Lithium.CChem.EDU will not be tried, as there is only one component "
"remaining from the local domain.  The search path can be changed from the "
