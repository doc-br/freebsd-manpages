"should contain a security considerations section describing what security "
"requirements can be broken through the misuse of that feature.  When writing "
"these sections, authors should attempt to achieve a happy medium between two "
"conflicting goals: brevity and completeness.  On one hand, security "
"consideration sections must not be too verbose, or busy readers might be "
"dissuaded from reading them.  On the other hand, security consideration "
"sections must not be incomplete, or they will fail in their purpose of "
"instructing the reader on how to avoid all insecure uses.  This document "
"provides guidelines for balancing brevity and completeness in the security "
"consideration section for a given feature of the E<.Fx> system."
