"C is a general purpose programming language, which has a strong connection "
"with the UNIX operating system and its derivatives, since the vast majority "
"of those systems were written in the C language.  The C language contains "
"some basic ideas from the BCPL language through the B language written by "
"Ken Thompson in 1970 for the DEC PDP-7 machines.  The development of the "
"UNIX operating system was started on a PDP-7 machine in assembly language, "
"but it made very difficult to port the existing code to other systems."

"In 1972 Dennis M. Ritchie worked out the C programming language for further "
"development of the UNIX operating system.  The idea was to implement only "
"the C compiler for different platforms, and implement most part of the "
"operating system in the new programming language to simplify the portability "
"between different architectures.  It follows that C is very eligible for "
"(but not limited to) writing operating systems and low-level applications."

"The C language did not have a specification or standardized version for a "
"long time.  It went through a lot of changes and improvements for ages.  In "
"1978, Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie published the first book "
"about C under the title \"The C Programming Language\".  We can think of "
"this book as the first specification of the language.  This version is often "
"referred as K&R C after the names of the authors.  Sometimes it is referred "
"as C78, as well, after the publishing year of the first edition of the book."

"It is important to notice, that the instruction set of the language is "
"limited to the most fundamental elements for simplicity.  Handling of the "
"standard I/O and such common functions are implemented in the libraries "
"shipped with the compiler.  As these functions are also widely used, it was "
"demanded to include into the description what requisites the library should "
"conform to, not just strictly the language itself.  Accordingly, the "
"aforementioned standards cover the library elements, as well.  The elements "
"of this standard library is still not enough for more complicated tasks.  In "
"this case the provided system calls of the given operating system can be "
"used.  To not lose the portability by using these system calls, the POSIX "
"(Portable Operating System Interface) standard evolved.  It describes what "
"functions should be available to keep portability.  Note, that POSIX is not "
"a C standard, but an operating system standard and thus is beyond the scope "
"of this manual.  The standards discussed below are all C standards and only "
"cover the C programming language and the accompanying library."

"After the publication of the book mentioned before, the American National "
"Standards Institute (ANSI) started to work on standardizing the language, "
"and they announced ANSI X3.159-1989 in 1989.  It is usually referred as ANSI "
"C or C89.  The main difference in this standard were the function "
"prototypes, which is a new way of declaring functions.  With the old-style "
"function declarations, the compiler was unable to check the sanity of the "
"actual parameters at a function call.  The old syntax was highly error-prone "
"because incompatible parameters were hard to detect in the program code and "
"the problem only showed up at run-time."

"In 1990, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted "
"the ANSI standard as ISO/IEC 9899:1990 in 1990.  This is also referred as "
"ISO C or C90.  It only contains negligible minor modifications against ANSI "
"C, so the two standards often considered to be fully equivalent.  This was a "
"very important milestone in the history of the C language, but the "
"development of the language did not stop."

"The ISO C standard was later extended with an amendment as ISO/IEC 9899 AM1 "
"in 1995.  This contained, for example, the wide-character support in wchar.h "
"and wctype.h.  Two corrigenda were also published: Technical Corrigendum 1 "
"as ISO/IEC 9899 TCOR1 in 1995 and Technical Corrigendum 2 as ISO/IEC 9899 "
"TCOR1 in 1996.  The continuous development and growth made it necessary to "
"work out a new standard, which contains the new features and fixes the known "
"defects and deficiencies of the language.  As a result, ISO/IEC 9899:1999 "
"was born in 1999.  Similarly to the other standards, this is referred after "
"the publication year as C99.  The improvements include the following:"
