"The libibverbs API is an abstract one. It is agnostic to any underlying "
"provider specific implementation. While this abstraction has the advantage "
"of user applications portability it has a performance penalty. For some "
"applications optimizing performance is more important than portability."

"The mlx5 direct verbs API is intended for such applications.  It exposes "
"mlx5 specific low level data path (send/receive/completion)  operations, "
"allowing the application to bypass the libibverbs data path API."

"Once an application uses the direct flow the locking scheme is fully managed "

"All Mellanox NIC devices starting from Connect-IB (Connect-IB, ConnectX-4, "
"ConnectX-4Lx, ConnectX-5, ...) implement the mlx5 API, thus using the mlx5 "
"direct verbs does not limit the applications to a single NIC HW device thus "
"keeping some level of portability."
