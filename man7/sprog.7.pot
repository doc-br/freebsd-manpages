"Writing secure applications takes a very scrutinous and pessimistic "
"outlook.  Applications should be run with the principle of E<.Dq Li least "
"privilege> so that no process is ever running with more than the bare "
"minimum access it needs to accomplish its function.  Previously tested code "
"should be reused whenever possible.  Generally, anything beyond the control "
"of a program should never be trusted.  This includes all forms of user "
"input, system resources, interprocess communication, and the timing of "
"events."

"One of the most common types of security problems is the buffer overflow.  "
"In short, if a program is not careful with the data it receives, it may be "
"possible for this data to be written across memory, overwriting the return "
"address for a function call, and the program will be forced to run code that "
"does unfriendly things."

"A good number of functions in the standard C library make it difficult or "
"even impossible to prevent buffer overflows when used.  These include E<.Xr "
"fscanf 3>, E<.Xr gets 3>, E<.Xr getwd 3>, E<.Xr realpath 3>, E<.Xr scanf 3>, "
"E<.Xr sprintf 3>, E<.Xr strcat 3>, E<.Xr strcpy 3>, E<.Xr vscanf 3>, and "

"Many other functions that deal with strings can also open up a potential "
"buffer overflow when not used carefully.  For example, E<.Xr strncat 3> does "
"not go out of its way to provide E<.Tn NUL> character termination.  Of "
"course, the proper length must always be specified.  Usage of E<.Xr strlcat "
"3> and E<.Xr strlcpy 3> ensure that strings are null terminated and of the "
"specified length."

"Functions that receive a string format must also be used carefully.  It is "
"possible for a string to contain additional format specifiers, which open up "
"another possibility for a buffer overflow.  Never pass a string with "
"untrusted data without using E<.Ql %s>.  Always use the proper secure idiom:"

"In many cases, it may be necessary for a program to operate with an "
"increased set of permissions.  Reasons for this include binding to protected "
"sockets, reading and writing certain files and directories, and access to "
"various resources.  Using a setuid program is frequently the solution.  "
"However, it is important that programs give up these privileges as soon as "
"possible.  For example, if a program is binding to a protected socket, it "
"should give up its privileges as soon as it has finished binding to that "
"socket.  This is accomplished with the E<.Xr setuid 2> family of system "
"calls."

"The traditional method of restricting a process is with the E<.Xr chroot 2> "

"Programs should not make assumptions about the environment in which they are "
"running.  This includes user input, signals, environment variables, system "
"resources, interprocess communications, and shared memory, amongst other "
"things that are beyond the control of the program.  They should not assume "
"that all forms of invalid data can be detected either.  Instead, they should "
"use positive filtering, and only allow a specific subset of inputs that are "
"known to be safe.  This is the same logic that an administrator should apply "

"A race condition is anomalous behavior caused by the relative timing of "

"before another.  The most common causes of race conditions are signals, "
"access checks, and file reads.  Signals are asynchronous by nature, so "
"special care must be taken while dealing with them.  Attempting to check "
"access with sequential non-atomic operations is a very bad idea, as files "
"can be moved and changed at any given time.  Instead of using a sequence of "
"E<.Xr access 2> and E<.Xr open 2>, use E<.Xr seteuid 2> and then call E<.Xr "
"open 2> directly.  Set E<.Xr umask 2> properly beforehand."
