"A Firewall is most commonly used to protect an internal network from an "
"outside network by preventing the outside network from making arbitrary "
"connections into the internal network.  Firewalls are also used to prevent "
"outside entities from spoofing internal IP addresses and to isolate services "
"such as NFS or SMBFS (Windows file sharing) within LAN segments."

"The E<.Fx> firewalling system also has the capability to limit bandwidth "
"using E<.Xr dummynet 4>.  This feature can be useful when you need to "
"guarantee a certain amount of bandwidth for a critical purpose.  For "
"example, if you are doing video conferencing over the Internet via your "
"office T1 (1.5 MBits/s), you may wish to bandwidth-limit all other T1 "
"traffic to 1 MBit/s in order to reserve at least 0.5 MBits for your video "
"conferencing connections.  Similarly if you are running a popular web or ftp "
"site from a colocation facility you might want to limit bandwidth to prevent "
"excessive bandwidth charges from your provider."

"Finally, E<.Fx> firewalls may be used to divert packets or change the "
"next-hop address for packets to help route them to the correct destination.  "
"Packet diversion is most often used to support NAT (network address "
"translation), which allows an internal network using a private IP space to "
"make connections to the outside for browsing or other purposes."

"Constructing a firewall may appear to be trivial, but most people get them "
"wrong.  The most common mistake is to create an exclusive firewall rather "
"than an inclusive firewall.  An exclusive firewall allows all packets "
"through except for those matching a set of rules.  An inclusive firewall "
"allows only packets matching the ruleset through.  Inclusive firewalls are "
"much, much safer than exclusive firewalls but a tad more difficult to build "
"properly.  The second most common mistake is to blackhole everything except "
"the particular port you want to let through.  TCP/IP needs to be able to get "
"certain types of ICMP errors to function properly - for example, to "
"implement MTU discovery.  Also, a number of common system daemons make "
"reverse connections to the E<.Sy auth> service in an attempt to authenticate "
"the user making a connection.  Auth is rather dangerous but the proper "
"implementation is to return a TCP reset for the connection attempt rather "
"than simply blackholing the packet.  We cover these and other quirks "
"involved with constructing a firewall in the sample firewall section below."

"You do not need to create a custom kernel to use the IP firewalling "
"features.  If you enable firewalling in your E<.Pa /etc/rc.conf> (see "
"below), the ipfw kernel module will be loaded automatically when necessary.  "
"However, if you are paranoid you can compile IPFW directly into the E<.Fx> "
"kernel by using the E<.Sy IPFIREWALL> option set.  If compiled in the "
"kernel, ipfw denies all packets by default, which means that, if you do not "
"load in a permissive ruleset via E<.Pa /etc/rc.conf>, rebooting into your "
"new kernel will take the network offline.  This can prevent you from being "
"able to access your system if you are not sitting at the console.  It is "
"also quite common to update a kernel to a new release and reboot before "
"updating the binaries.  This can result in an incompatibility between the "
"E<.Xr ipfw 8> program and the kernel which prevents it from running in the "
"boot sequence, also resulting in an inaccessible machine.  Because of these "
"problems the E<.Sy IPFIREWALL_DEFAULT_TO_ACCEPT> kernel option is also "
"available which changes the default firewall to pass through all packets.  "
"Note, however, that using this option may open a small window of opportunity "
"during booting where your firewall passes all packets.  Still, it is a good "
"option to use while getting up to speed with E<.Fx> firewalling.  Get rid of "
"it once you understand how it all works to close the loophole, though.  "
"There is a third option called E<.Sy IPDIVERT> which allows you to use the "
"firewall to divert packets to a user program and is necessary if you wish to "
"use E<.Xr natd 8> to give private internal networks access to the outside "
"world.  If you want to be able to limit the bandwidth used by certain types "
"of traffic, the E<.Sy DUMMYNET> option must be used to enable E<.Em ipfw "
"pipe> rules."

"Here is an example ipfw-based firewall taken from a machine with three "

"LAN are dual-homed with both internal 10.\\& IP addresses and "
"Internet-routed IP addresses.  In our example, 192.100.5.x represents the "
"Internet-routed IP block while 10.x.x.x represents the internal networks.  "
"While it is not relevant to the example, 10.0.1.x is assigned as the "

"by giving the machines on the exposed LAN internal 10.0.0.x addresses as "
"well as exposed addresses.  The idea here is that you can bind internal "
