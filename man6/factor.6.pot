"The E<.Nm> utility will factor positive integers.  When a number is "
"factored, it is printed, followed by a E<.Ql \\&:>, and the list of factors "
"on a single line.  Factors are listed in ascending order, and are preceded "
"by a space.  If a factor divides a value more than once, it will be printed "
"more than once."
