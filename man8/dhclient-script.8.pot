"The DHCP client network configuration script is invoked from time to time by "
"E<.Xr dhclient 8>.  This script is used by the DHCP client to set each "
"interface's initial configuration prior to requesting an address, to test "
"the address once it has been offered, and to set the interface's final "
"configuration once a lease has been acquired.  If no lease is acquired, the "
"script is used to test predefined leases, if any, and also called once if no "
"valid lease can be identified."

#.  No standard client script exists for some operating systems, even though
