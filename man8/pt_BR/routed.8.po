"The E<.Nm> utility is a daemon invoked at boot time to manage the network "
"routing tables.  It uses Routing Information Protocol, RIPv1 (RFC\\ 1058), "
"RIPv2 (RFC\\ 1723), and Internet Router Discovery Protocol (RFC 1256)  to "
"maintain the kernel routing table.  The RIPv1 protocol is based on the "
"reference E<.Bx 4.3> daemon."

"It listens on the E<.Xr udp 4> socket for the E<.Xr route 8> service (see E<."

"router, E<.Nm> periodically supplies copies of its routing tables to any "
"directly connected hosts and networks.  It also advertises or solicits "
"default routes using Router Discovery ICMP messages."

"When started (or when a network interface is later turned on), E<.Nm> uses "
"an AF_ROUTE address family facility to find those directly connected "
"interfaces configured into the system and marked \"up\".  It adds necessary "

"first started, and provided there is at least one interface on which RIP has "
"not been disabled, E<.Nm> deletes all pre-existing non-static routes in "
