"The E<.Nm> utility is a script which produces a minimal implementation of "

"The E<.Nm> utility was originally created to build simple standalone systems "
"such as firewalls or bridges, but because of the ability to cross-build "
"images with different source trees than the one in the server, it can be "

"The boot media (historically a floppy disk, but also small CDROM or USB "
