"The E<.Nm> command copies a data storage file for an MDS file from one DS to "
"another DS.  It is normally used to recover data files onto a repaired DS, "
"but can also be used to manually migrate a data storage file from one DS to "
"a different one.  By default, the command will copy the data storage file "
"for E<.Dq mdsfile> to one of the other DSs to create a mirror of it.  This "
"might be done if the file was created before mirroring was enabled on the "
"pNFS service and now needs to be mirrored."
