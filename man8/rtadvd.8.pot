"E<.Nm> sends router advertisement packets to the specified E<.Ar "

"If there is no configuration file entry for an interface, or if the "

"E<.Nm> also watches the routing table.  If an interface direct route is "

"Similarly, when an interface direct route is deleted, E<.Nm> will start "
"advertising the prefixes with zero valid and preferred lifetimes to help the "
"receiving hosts switch to a new prefix when renumbering.  Note, however, "
"that the zero valid lifetime cannot invalidate the autoconfigured addresses "
"at a receiving host immediately.  According to the specification, the host "
"will retain the address for a certain period, which will typically be two "
"hours.  The zero lifetimes rather intend to make the address deprecated, "
"indicating that a new non-deprecated address should be used as the source "
"address of a new connection.  This behavior will last for two hours.  Then "
"E<.Nm> will completely remove the prefix from the advertising list, and "
"succeeding advertisements will not contain the prefix information."

"Basically, hosts MUST NOT send Router Advertisement messages at any time "
"(RFC 4861, Section 6.2.3).  However, it would sometimes be useful to allow "
"hosts to advertise some parameters such as prefix information and link MTU.  "
"Thus, E<.Nm> can be invoked if router lifetime is explicitly set zero on "
"every advertising interface."
