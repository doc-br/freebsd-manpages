"The E<.Nm> utility maintains the proper relationship between the kernel "
"clock, which is always set to UTC and the CMOS clock, which may be set to "
"local time.  The E<.Nm> utility also informs the kernel about machine "
"timezone shifts in order to maintain proper timestamps for local time file "
"systems such as the MS-DOS file system.  The main purpose of maintaining "
"these timestamps properly is to keep the timestamps of a E<.Fx> MS-DOS file "
"system and an MS-DOS operating system synchronized when they are installed "
"on the same system rather than fixing broken MS-DOS file timestamps.  If the "
"file E<.Pa /etc/wall_cmos_clock> exists, it means that the CMOS clock keeps "
"local time (MS-DOS and MS-Windows compatible mode).  If that file does not "
"exist, it means that the CMOS clock keeps UTC time.  The E<.Nm> utility "
"passes this state to the E<.Pa machdep.wall_cmos_clock> kernel variable."

"into the background.  Then, for a local time CMOS clock, E<.Nm> reads the "
"local time from it and sets the kernel clock to the corresponding UTC time.  "

"This form is used to update the local time CMOS clock and kernel E<.Pa "
