"The E<.Nm> utility makes it possible to expand an UFS file system.  Before "
"running E<.Nm> the partition or slice containing the file system must be "
"extended using E<.Xr gpart 8>.  If you are using volumes you must enlarge "
"them by using E<.Xr gvinum 8>.  The E<.Nm> utility extends the size of the "
"file system on the specified special file.  The following options are "
"available:"
