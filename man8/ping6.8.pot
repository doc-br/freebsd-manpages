"There have been many discussions on why we separate E<.Nm> and E<.Xr ping "

"From a developer's point of view: since the underling raw sockets API is "
"totally different between IPv4 and IPv6, we would end up having two types of "
"code base.  There would actually be less benefit to uniform the two commands "
"into a single command from the developer's standpoint."

"From an operator's point of view: unlike ordinary network applications like "
"remote login tools, we are usually aware of address family when using "
"network management tools.  We do not just want to know the reachability to "
"the host, but want to know the reachability to the host via a particular "
"network protocol such as IPv6.  Thus, even if we had a unified E<.Xr ping 8> "
"command for both IPv4 and IPv6, we would usually type a E<.Fl 6> or E<.Fl 4> "
"option (or something like those) to specify the particular address family.  "
"This essentially means that we have two different commands."
