"At one time, the only Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software easily available "

"such as E<.Xr mail 1> had the path and calling conventions expected by E<.Xr "
"sendmail 8> compiled in."

"It would be difficult to modify all MUA software typically available on a "
"system, so most of the authors of alternative MTAs have written their front "

"E<.Xr sendmail 8> also typically has aliases named E<.Xr mailq 1> and E<.Xr "
"newaliases 1> linked to it.  The program knows to behave differently when "
"its E<.Va argv[0]> is E<.Dq mailq> or E<.Dq newaliases> and behaves "
"appropriately.  Typically, replacement MTAs provide similar functionality, "
"either through a program that also switches behavior based on calling name, "
"or through a set of programs that provide similar functionality."

"Although having drop-in replacements for E<.Xr sendmail 8> helps in "

"configuration problems for many administrators, since they may wish to "
"install a new MTA without altering the system provided E<.Pa /usr>.  (This "
"may be, for example, to avoid having upgrade problems when a new version of "
"the system is installed over the old.)  They may also have a shared E<.Pa "
"/usr> among several machines, and may wish to avoid placing implicit "
