msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> utility is designed to print out a dependency ordering of a set "
"of interdependent files.  Typically it is used to find an execution sequence "
"for a set of shell scripts in which certain files must be executed before "
"others."

"Each file passed to E<.Nm> must be annotated with special lines (which look "
"like comments to the shell) which indicate the dependencies the files have "
"upon certain points in the sequence, known as E<.Dq conditions>, and which "
"indicate, for each file, which E<.Dq conditions> may be expected to be "
"filled by that file."
