"The E<.Nm> utility should be scheduled to run periodically by E<.Xr cron "

"period's logs in it, E<.Dq Va logfile Ns Li \\&.1> has the next to last "

"logs.  It is also possible to let archived log filenames be created using "
"the time the log file was archived instead of the sequential number using "

"(such as how many backup copies are kept, and what kind of compression is "
"done).  When a daemon does execute E<.Nm> with the E<.Fl R> option, it "
"should make sure all of the log files are closed before calling E<.Nm>, and "

"process will also want to specify the E<.Fl s> option, so E<.Nm> will not "
"send a signal to the very process which called it to force the rotate.  "
