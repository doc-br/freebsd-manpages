"In order for the BIOS to boot the kernel, certain conventions must be "
"adhered to.  Sector 0 of the disk must contain boot code, a slice table, and "
"a magic number.  BIOS slices can be used to break the disk up into several "
"pieces.  The BIOS brings in sector 0 and verifies the magic number.  The "
"sector 0 boot code then searches the slice table to determine which slice is "
"marked E<.Dq active>.  This boot code then brings in the bootstrap from the "
"active slice and, if marked bootable, runs it.  Under E<.Tn DOS>, you can "
"have one or more slices with one active.  The E<.Tn DOS> E<.Nm> utility can "
"be used to divide space on the disk into slices and set one active."
