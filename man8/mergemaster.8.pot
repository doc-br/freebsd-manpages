msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> utility is a Bourne shell script which is designed to aid you in "
"updating the various configuration and other files associated with E<.Fx>.  "
"It is E<.Sy HIGHLY> recommended that you back up your E<.Pa /etc> directory "
"before beginning this process."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/usr.sbin/mergemaster/mergemaster.8:83

"The script uses E<.Pa /usr/src/Makefile> to build a temporary root "
"environment from E<.Pa /> down, populating that environment with the various "
"files.  You can specify a different source directory with the E<.Fl m> "
"command line option, or specify the destination directory with the E<.Fl D> "
"option.  It then compares each file in that environment to its installed "
"counterpart.  When the script finds a change in the new file, or there is no "
"installed version of the new file it gives you four options to deal with "
"it.  You can install the new file as is, delete the new file, merge the old "
"and new files (as appropriate) using E<.Xr sdiff 1> or leave the file in the "
"temporary root environment to merge by hand later."

"By default it creates the temporary root in E<.Pa /var/tmp/temproot> and "
"compares the Version Control System (VCS) Id strings ($FreeBSD)  for files "
"that have them, deleting the temporary file if the strings match.  If there "
"is no Id string, or if the strings are different it compares the files "
"themselves.  You can also specify that the script ignore the Id strings and "
"compare every file with the E<.Fl s> option.  Using the E<.Fl F> option "
"E<.Nm> will install the new file for you if they differ only by VCS strings."

"The merge menu option is designed to let you easily combine your "

"The E<.Nm> utility checks your umask and issues a warning for anything other "

"The E<.Nm> utility will source scripts that you specify right before it "

"comparison is named in E<.Ev MM_PRE_COMPARE_SCRIPT>, and the one sourced "
"after the script is done is E<.Ev MM_EXIT_SCRIPT>.  This is the recommended "
"way to specify local modifications, or files that you want to give special "
"handling to.  This includes files that you want to be deleted without being "
"compared.  Because the named scripts are sourced from within E<.Nm>, all of "
"the script's variables are available for use in your custom script.  You can "
"also use E<.Pa /etc/mergemaster.rc> which will be read before E<.Pa "
".mergemasterrc>.  Options specified on the command line are updated last, "
