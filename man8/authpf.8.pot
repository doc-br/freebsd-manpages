"E<.Nm> is a user shell for authenticating gateways.  It is used to change "
"E<.Xr pf 4> rules when a user authenticates and starts a session with E<.Xr "
"sshd 8> and to undo these changes when the user's session exits.  Typical "
"use would be for a gateway that authenticates users before allowing them "
"Internet use, or a gateway that allows different users into different "
"places.  Combined with properly set up filter rules and secure switches, "
"E<.Nm> can be used to ensure users are held accountable for their network "
"traffic.  It is meant to be used with users who can connect via E<.Xr ssh 1> "
"only, and requires the E<.Xr pf 4> subsystem and an E<.Xr fdescfs 5> file "
"system mounted at E<.Pa /dev/fd> to be enabled."

"classifying connections by IP address; in this case the client's IP address "
"is not provided to the packet filter via the E<.Ar client_ip> macro or the "
