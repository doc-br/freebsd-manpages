"It is normally used in the script E<.Pa /etc/rc> during automatic reboot.  "
"Traditionally, E<.Nm> is invoked before the file systems are mounted and all "
"checks are done to completion at that time.  If background checking is "
"available, E<.Nm> is invoked twice.  It is first invoked at the traditional "
"time, before the file systems are mounted, with the E<.Fl F> flag to do "
"checking on all the file systems that cannot do background checking.  It is "
"then invoked a second time, after the system has completed going multiuser, "
"with the E<.Fl B> flag to do checking on all the file systems that can do "
"background checking.  Unlike the foreground checking, the background "
"checking is started asynchronously so that other system activity can proceed "
"even on the file systems that are being checked."
