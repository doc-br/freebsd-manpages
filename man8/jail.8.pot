"It might be a good idea to add an address alias flag such that daemons "
"listening on all IPs E<.Pq Dv INADDR_ANY> will not bind on that address, "
"which would facilitate building a safe host environment such that host "
"daemons do not impose on services offered from within jails.  Currently, the "
"simplest answer is to minimize services offered on the host, possibly "
"limiting it to services offered from E<.Xr inetd 8> which is easily "
"configurable."

"Great care should be taken when managing directories visible within the "
"jail.  For example, if a jailed process has its current working directory "
"set to a directory that is moved out of the jail's chroot, then the process "
"may gain access to the file space outside of the jail.  It is recommended "
"that directories always be copied, rather than moved, out of a jail."

"In addition, there are several ways in which an unprivileged user outside "
"the jail can cooperate with a privileged user inside the jail and thereby "
"obtain elevated privileges in the host environment.  Most of these attacks "
"can be mitigated by ensuring that the jail root is not accessible to "
"unprivileged users in the host environment.  Regardless, as a general rule, "
"untrusted users with privileged access to a jail should not be given access "
"to the host environment."
