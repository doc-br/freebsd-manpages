"The E<.Pa /rescue> directory contains a collection of common utilities "
"intended for use in recovering a badly damaged system.  With the transition "
"to a dynamically-linked root beginning with E<.Fx 5.2>, there is a real "
"possibility that the standard tools in E<.Pa /bin> and E<.Pa /sbin> may "
"become non-functional due to a failed upgrade or a disk error.  The tools in "
"E<.Pa /rescue> are statically linked and should therefore be more resistant "
"to damage.  However, being statically linked, the tools in E<.Pa /rescue> "
"are also less functional than the standard utilities.  In particular, they "
"do not have full use of the locale, E<.Xr pam 3>, and nsswitch libraries."

"the first thing to try running is the standard shell, E<.Pa /bin/sh>.  If "
"that fails, try running E<.Pa /rescue/sh>, which is the E<.Nm> shell.  To "
"repair the system, the root partition must first be remounted read-write.  "

"The E<.Pa /rescue> tools are compiled using E<.Xr crunchgen 1>, which makes "
"them considerably more compact than the standard utilities.  To build a "
"E<.Fx> system where space is critical, E<.Pa /rescue> can be used as a "
"replacement for the standard E<.Pa /bin> and E<.Pa /sbin> directories; "
"simply change E<.Pa /bin> and E<.Pa /sbin> to be symbolic links pointing to "
"E<.Pa /rescue>.  Since E<.Pa /rescue> is statically linked, it should also "
"be possible to dispense with much of E<.Pa /usr/lib> in such an environment."

"Most of the E<.Nm> tools work even in a fairly crippled system.  The most "
"egregious exception is the E<.Nm> version of E<.Xr vi 1>, which currently "
"requires that E<.Pa /usr> be mounted so that it can access the E<.Xr termcap "

"added into the E<.Xr ncurses 3> library, so that E<.Pa /rescue/vi> can be "
"used even in a system where E<.Pa /usr> cannot immediately be mounted.  In "
"the meantime, the E<.Nm> version of the E<.Xr ed 1> editor can be used from "
"E<.Pa /rescue/ed> if you need to edit files, but cannot mount E<.Pa /usr>."
