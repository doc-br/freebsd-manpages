"The E<.Nm> utility can be called to ensure that all disk writes have been "
"completed before the processor is halted in a way not suitably done by E<.Xr "
"reboot 8> or E<.Xr halt 8>.  Generally, it is preferable to use E<.Xr reboot "
"8> or E<.Xr halt 8> to shut down the system, as they may perform additional "
"actions such as resynchronizing the hardware clock and flushing internal "
"caches before performing a final E<.Nm>."
