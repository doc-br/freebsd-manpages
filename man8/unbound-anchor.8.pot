"B<Unbound-anchor> performs setup or update of the root trust anchor for "
"DNSSEC validation.  The program fetches the trust anchor with the method "
"from RFC7958 when regular RFC5011 update fails to bring it up to date.  It "
"can be run (as root) from the commandline, or run as part of startup "
"scripts.  Before you start the I<unbound>(8) DNS server."
