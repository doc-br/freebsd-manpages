"The E<.Nm> utility performs the inverse function of E<.Xr dump 8>.  A full "
"backup of a file system may be restored and subsequent incremental backups "
"layered on top of it.  Single files and directory subtrees may be restored "
"from full or partial backups.  The E<.Nm> utility works across a network; to "
"do this see the E<.Fl f> and E<.Fl P> flags described below.  Other "
"arguments to the command are file or directory names specifying the files "
"that are to be restored.  Unless the E<.Fl h> flag is specified (see below), "
"the appearance of a directory name refers to the files and (recursively) "
"subdirectories of that directory."

"To do a network restore, you have to run restore as root.  This is due to "
"the previous security history of dump and restore.  (restore is written to "
"be setuid root, but we are not certain all bugs are gone from the restore "
"code - run setuid at your own risk.)"

"The temporary files E<.Pa /tmp/rstdir*> and E<.Pa /tmp/rstmode*> are "
"generated with a unique name based on the date of the dump and the process "
"ID (see E<.Xr mktemp 3>), except for when E<.Fl r> or E<.Fl R> is used.  "
"Because E<.Fl R> allows you to restart a E<.Fl r> operation that may have "
"been interrupted, the temporary files should be the same across different "
"processes.  In all other cases, the files are unique because it is possible "
"to have two different dumps started at the same time, and separate "
"operations should not conflict with each other."
