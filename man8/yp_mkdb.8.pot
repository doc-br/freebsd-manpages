"The E<.Nm> utility creates E<.Xr db 3> style databases for use with E<.Fx Ns "
"'s> NIS server.  The E<.Nm> utility reads data from E<.Ar inputfile>, and "
"writes it to E<.Ar dbname> in E<.Xr db 3> format (using the hash table "
"method).  The input should be in 'key data' format, which is to say two "
"fields of E<.Tn ASCII> data separated by white space.  The first field is "
"assumed to be the key, and everything else is assumed to be the data.  These "
"databases are typically stored in E<.Pa /var/yp/[domainname]> where E<.Ar "
"domainname> is the name of the NIS domain being served.  The E<.Nm> utility "
"is usually invoked by E<.Pa /var/yp/Makefile>.  The E<.Nm> utility can also "
"be used to dump an NIS database file so that its contents can be examined.  "
"For security reasons, all databases that E<.Nm> creates are readable and "
"writable by owner only (and usually the owner is root)."
