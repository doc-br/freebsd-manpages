"The E<.Nm> utility is the last stage of the boot process.  It normally runs "
"the automatic reboot sequence as described in E<.Xr rc 8>, and if this "
"succeeds, begins multi-user operation.  If the reboot scripts fail, E<.Nm> "
"commences single-user operation by giving the super-user a shell on the "
"console.  The E<.Nm> utility may be passed parameters from the boot program "
"to prevent the system from going multi-user and to instead execute a "
"single-user shell without starting the normal daemons.  The system is then "
"quiescent for maintenance work and may later be made to go to multi-user by "
"exiting the single-user shell (with ^D).  This causes E<.Nm> to run the "
"E<.Pa /etc/rc> start up command file in fastboot mode (skipping disk "
"checks)."

"If the E<.Em console> entry in the E<.Xr ttys 5> file is marked E<.Dq "

"skipped if the E<.Em console> is marked as E<.Dq secure>.  Note that the "
"password check does not protect from variables such as E<.Va init_script> "

"If the system security level (see E<.Xr security 7>)  is initially nonzero, "
"then E<.Nm> leaves it unchanged.  Otherwise, E<.Nm> raises the level to 1 "
"before going multi-user for the first time.  Since the level cannot be "
"reduced, it will be at least 1 for subsequent operation, even on return to "
"single-user.  If a level higher than 1 is desired while running multi-user, "
"it can be set before going multi-user, e.g., by the startup script E<.Xr rc "
