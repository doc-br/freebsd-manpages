"The E<.Nm> utility is the command script which controls the automatic boot "
"process after being called by E<.Xr init 8>.  The E<.Nm rc.local> script "
"contains commands which are pertinent only to a specific site.  Typically, "
"the E<.Pa /usr/local/etc/rc.d/> mechanism is used instead of E<.Nm rc.local> "
"these days but if you want to use E<.Nm rc.local>, it is still supported.  "
"In this case, it should source E<.Pa /etc/rc.conf> and contain additional "
"custom startup code for your system.  The best way to handle E<.Nm "
"rc.local>, however, is to separate it out into E<.Nm rc.d/> style scripts "
"and place them under E<.Pa /usr/local/etc/rc.d/>.  The E<.Nm rc.conf> file "
