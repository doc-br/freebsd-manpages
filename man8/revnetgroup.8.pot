"The E<.Nm> utility processes the contents of a file in E<.Xr netgroup 5> "
"format into what is called E<.Pa reverse netgroup> form.  That is, where the "
"original file shows netgroup memberships in terms of which members reside in "
"a particular group, the reverse netgroup format specifies what groups are "
"associated with a particular member.  This information is used to generate "
"the E<.Pa netgroup.byuser> and E<.Pa netgroup.byhost> E<.Tn NIS> maps.  "
"These reverse netgroup maps are used to help speed up netgroup lookups, "
"particularly for the E<.Fn innetgr> library function."

"For example, the standard E<.Pa /etc/netgroup> file may list a netgroup and "
"a list of its members.  Here, the netgroup is considered the E<.Em key> and "
"the member names are the E<.Em data>.  By contrast, the reverse E<.Pa "
"netgroup.byuser> database lists each unique member as the key and the "
"netgroups to which the members belong become the data.  Separate databases "
"are created to hold information pertaining to users and hosts; this allows "
"netgroup username lookups and netgroup hostname lookups to be performed "
"using independent keyspaces."

"By constructing these reverse netgroup databases (and the corresponding "
"E<.Tn NIS> maps) in advance, the E<.Xr getnetgrent 3> library functions are "
"spared from having to work out the dependencies themselves on the fly.  This "
"is important on networks with large numbers of users and hosts, since it can "
"take a considerable amount of time to process very large netgroup databases."
