"It uses a built in list of authoritative nameservers for the root zone (.), "
"the so called root hints.  On receiving a DNS query it will ask the root "
"nameservers for an answer and will in almost all cases receive a delegation "
"to a top level domain (TLD) authoritative nameserver.  It will then ask that "
"nameserver for an answer.  It will recursively continue until an answer is "
"found or no answer is available (NXDOMAIN).  For performance and efficiency "
"reasons that answer is cached for a certain time (the answer's time-to-live "
"or TTL).  A second query for the same name will then be answered from the "
"cache.  Unbound can also do DNSSEC validation."
