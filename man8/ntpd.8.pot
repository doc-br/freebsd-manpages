"The E<.Nm> utility is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains "
"the system time of day in synchronism with Internet standard time servers.  "
"It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version "
"4, as defined by RFC\\-5905, but also retains compatibility with version 3, "
"as defined by RFC\\-1305, and versions 1 and 2, as defined by RFC\\-1059 and "
"RFC\\-1119, respectively."

"The E<.Nm> utility does most computations in 64\\-bit floating point "
"arithmetic and does relatively clumsy 64\\-bit fixed point operations only "
"when necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds.  "
"While the ultimate precision is not achievable with ordinary workstations "
"and networks of today, it may be required with future gigahertz CPU clocks "
"and gigabit LANs."

"Ordinarily, E<.Nm> reads the E<.Xr ntp.conf 5> configuration file at startup "
"time in order to determine the synchronization sources and operating modes.  "
"It is also possible to specify a working, although limited, configuration "
"entirely on the command line, obviating the need for a configuration file.  "
"This may be particularly useful when the local host is to be configured as a "
"broadcast/multicast client, with all peers being determined by listening to "
"broadcasts at run time."

"The E<.Nm> utility operates by exchanging messages with one or more "

"whether for the first or subsequent times, the program requires several "
"exchanges from the majority of these servers so the signal processing and "
"mitigation algorithms can accumulate and groom the data and set the clock.  "
"In order to protect the network from bursts, the initial poll interval for "
"each server is delayed an interval randomized over a few seconds.  At the "
"default initial poll interval of 64s, several minutes can elapse before the "
"clock is set.  This initial delay to set the clock can be safely and "

"Most operating systems and hardware of today incorporate a time\\-of\\-year "

"the machine is booted, the chip is used to initialize the operating system "
"time.  After the machine has synchronized to a NTP server, the operating "
"system corrects the chip from time to time.  In the default case, if E<.Nm> "
"detects that the time on the host is more than 1000s from the server time, "
"E<.Nm> assumes something must be terribly wrong and the only reliable action "
"is for the operator to intervene and set the clock by hand.  (Reasons for "
"this include there is no TOY chip, or its battery is dead, or that the TOY "
"chip is just of poor quality.)  This causes E<.Nm> to exit with a panic "
"message to the system log.  The E<.Fl g> option overrides this check and the "
"clock will be set to the server time regardless of the chip time (up to 68 "
"years in the past or future \\(em this is a limitation of the NTPv4 "
"protocol).  However, and to protect against broken hardware, such as when "
