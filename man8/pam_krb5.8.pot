"The Kerberos 5 service module for PAM, typically E<.Pa "

"authentication, account management, and password management.  It also "
"provides null functions for session management.  The E<.Pa pam_krb5.so> "
"module is a shared object that can be dynamically loaded to provide the "
"necessary functionality upon demand.  Its path is specified in the PAM "
