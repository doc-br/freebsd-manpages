msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> utility is used to query a RIP network routing daemon, such as "
"E<.Xr routed 8>, for its routing table by sending a E<.Em request> or E<.Em "
"poll> command.  The routing information in any routing E<.Em response> "
"packets returned is displayed numerically and symbolically."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/sbin/routed/rtquery/rtquery.8:71

"The E<.Nm> utility by default uses the E<.Em request> command.  When the "
"E<.Fl p> option is specified, E<.Nm> uses the E<.Em poll> command, an "
"undocumented extension to the RIP protocol supported by the commercial E<.Nm "
"gated> routing product.  When querying E<.Nm gated>, the E<.Em poll> command "
"is preferred over the E<.Em request> command because the response is not "
"subject to Split Horizon and/or Poisoned Reverse, and because some versions "
"of E<.Nm gated> do not answer the E<.Em request> command.  The E<.Xr routed "
"8> utility does not answer the E<.Em poll> command, but recognizes E<.Em "
"requests> coming from E<.Nm> and so answers completely."
