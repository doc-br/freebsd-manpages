"B<Qtool> moves the queue files used by sendmail between queues. It uses the "
"same locking mechanism as sendmail so can be safely used while sendmail is "
"running.  However, it should not be used when queue groups have been "
"configured to move queue files into directories to which they do not belong "
"according to the queue group selections made in the sendmail.cf file.  "
"Unless you are absolutely sure you do not interfere with the queue group "
"selection mechanism, do not move queue files around."
