"The E<.Nm> utility prints out the UFS super block and cylinder group "
"information for the file system or special device specified, unless the "
"E<.Fl f>, E<.Fl l> or E<.Fl m> flag is specified.  The listing is very long "
"and detailed.  This command is useful mostly for finding out certain file "
"system information such as the file system block size and minimum free space "
"percentage."

"If E<.Fl f> is specified, a sorted list of all free fragments and free "
"fragment ranges, as represented in cylinder group block free lists, is "
"printed.  If the flag is specified twice, contiguous free fragments are not "
"collapsed into ranges and instead printed in a simple list.  Fragment "
"numbers may be converted to raw byte offsets by multiplying by the fragment "
"size, which may be useful when recovering deleted data."
