"The E<.Nm> utility is a system daemon that runs in the background all the "
"time.  Whenever a device is added to or removed from the device tree, E<.Nm> "
"will execute actions specified in E<.Xr devd.conf 5>.  For example, E<.Nm> "
"might execute E<.Xr dhclient 8> when an Ethernet adapter is added to the "
"system, and kill the E<.Xr dhclient 8> instance when the same adapter is "
"removed.  Another example would be for E<.Nm> to use a table to locate and "
"load via E<.Xr kldload 8> the proper driver for an unrecognized device that "
"is added to the system."

"The E<.Nm> utility hooks into the E<.Xr devctl 4> device driver.  This "
"device driver has hooks into the device configuration system.  When nodes "
"are added or deleted from the tree, this device will deliver information "
"about the event to E<.Nm>.  Once E<.Nm> has parsed the message, it will "
"search its action list for that kind of event and perform the action with "
"the highest matching value.  For most mundane uses, the default handlers are "
"adequate.  However, for more advanced users, the power is present to tweak "
"every aspect of what happens."

"The E<.Nm> utility reads E<.Pa /etc/devd.conf> or the alternate "

"drive the rest of the process.  While the format of this file is described "
"in E<.Xr devd.conf 5>, some basics are covered here.  In the E<.Ic options> "
"section, one can define multiple directories to search for config files.  "
"All files in these directories whose names match the pattern E<.Pa *.conf> "
"are parsed.  These files are intended to be installed by third party vendors "
"that wish to hook into the E<.Nm> system without modifying the user's other "
