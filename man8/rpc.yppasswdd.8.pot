"The E<.Nm> utility allows users to change their NIS passwords and certain "
"other information using the E<.Xr yppasswd 1> and E<.Xr ypchpass 1> "
"commands.  The E<.Nm> utility is an RPC-based server that accepts incoming "
"password change requests, authenticates them, places the updated information "
"in the E<.Pa /var/yp/master.passwd> template file and then updates the NIS "
"E<.Pa master.passwd> and E<.Pa passwd> maps."

"The E<.Nm> utility allows a normal NIS user to change his or her NIS "
"password, full name (also known as 'GECOS' field) or shell.  These updates "
"are typically done using the E<.Xr yppasswd 1>, E<.Xr ypchfn 1>, E<.Xr "
"ypchsh 1>, or E<.Xr ypchpass 1> commands.  (Some administrators do not want "
"users to be able to change their full name information or shells; the server "
"can be invoked with option flags that disallow such changes.)  When the "
"server receives an update request, it compares the address of the client "
"making the request against the E<.Pa securenets> rules outlined in E<.Pa "
"/var/yp/securenets>.  (See the E<.Xr ypserv 8> manual page for more "
"information on securenets; the E<.Nm> utility uses the same access control "
"mechanism as E<.Xr ypserv 8>.)"

"The server then checks the 'old' password supplied by the user to make sure "
"it is valid, then performs some sanity checks on the updated information "
"(these include checking for embedded control characters, colons or invalid "
"shells).  Once it is satisfied that the update request is valid, the server "
"modifies the template password file (the default is E<.Pa "
"/var/yp/master.passwd>)  and then runs the E<.Pa /usr/libexec/yppwupdate> "
"script to rebuild the NIS maps.  (This script has two arguments passed to "
"it: the absolute pathname of the password template that was modified and the "
"name of the domain that is to be updated.  These in turn are passed to E<.Pa "

"with the E<.Fl a> flag, the super-user can even add new entries to the maps "
