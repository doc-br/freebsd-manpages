"The E<.Nm> utility is used for setting up a virtual storage device of "
"arbitrary large size E<.Pq for example, several TB>, consisting of an "
"arbitrary number of physical storage devices with the total size which is "
"equal to or smaller than the virtual size.  Data for the virtual devices "
"will be allocated from physical devices on demand.  The idea behind E<.Nm> "
"is similar to the concept of Virtual Memory in operating systems, "
"effectively allowing users to overcommit on storage E<.Pq free file system "
"space>.  The concept is also known as \"thin provisioning\" in "
"virtualization environments, only here it is implemented on the level of "
"physical storage devices."
