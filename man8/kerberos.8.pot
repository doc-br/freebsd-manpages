"Kerberos is a network authentication system. Its purpose is to securely "
"authenticate users and services in an insecure network environment."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/crypto/heimdal/lib/krb5/kerberos.8:49
msgid ""
"This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a trusted third party, keeping "
"a database with secret keys for all users and services (collectively called "
"E<.Em principals>)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/crypto/heimdal/lib/krb5/kerberos.8:56
msgid ""
"Each principal belongs to exactly one E<.Em realm>, which is the "
"administrative domain in Kerberos. A realm usually corresponds to an "
"organisation, and the realm should normally be derived from that "
"organisation's domain name. A realm is served by one or more Kerberos "
"servers."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/crypto/heimdal/lib/krb5/kerberos.8:62

"The authentication process involves exchange of E<.Sq tickets> and E<.Sq "
"authenticators> which together prove the principal's identity."

msgid ""
"When you login to the Kerberos system, either through the normal system "
"login or with the E<.Xr kinit 1> program, you acquire a E<.Em ticket "
"granting ticket> which allows you to get new tickets for other services, "
"such as E<.Ic telnet> or E<.Ic ftp>, without giving your password."

msgid ""
"The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late 1980's as part "
"of the Athena Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Versions "
"one through three never reached outside MIT, but version 4 was (and still "
"is) quite popular, especially in the academic community, but is also used in "
"commercial products like the AFS filesystem."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/crypto/heimdal/lib/krb5/kerberos.8:103
msgid ""
"The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the code was "
"not too well written (since it had been developed over a long time), and it "
"has a number of known security problems. To resolve many of these issues "
"work on version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC 1510 in 1993. IETF "
"RFC 1510 was obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120, also known as Kerberos "
"clarifications. With the arrival of IETF RFC 4120, the work on adding "
"extensibility and internationalization have started (Kerberos extensions), "
"and a new RFC will hopefully appear soon."
