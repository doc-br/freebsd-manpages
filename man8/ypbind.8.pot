msgid ""
"The E<.Nm> utility is the process that maintains NIS binding information.  "
"At startup, it searches for an NIS server responsible for serving the "
"system's default domain (as set by the E<.Xr domainname 1> command) using "
"network broadcasts.  Once it receives a reply, it will store the address of "
"the server and other information in a special file located in E<.Pa "
"/var/yp/binding>.  The NIS routines in the standard C library can then use "
"this file when processing NIS requests.  There may be several such files "
"since it is possible for an NIS client to be bound to more than one domain."

#. type: Plain text
#: /usr/src/usr.sbin/ypbind/ypbind.8:81
msgid ""
"After a binding has been established, E<.Nm> will send DOMAIN_NONACK "
"requests to the NIS server at one minute intervals.  If it fails to receive "
"a reply to one of these requests, E<.Nm> assumes that the server is no "
"longer running and resumes its network broadcasts until another binding is "
"established.  The E<.Nm> utility will also log warning messages using the "
"E<.Xr syslog 3> facility each time it detects that a server has stopped "
"responding, as well as when it has bound to a new server."

"It is possible to force E<.Nm> to bind to a particular NIS server host for a "
"given domain by using the E<.Xr ypset 8> command.  However, E<.Nm> refuses "
"YPBINDPROC_SETDOM requests by default since it has no way of knowing exactly "
"who is sending them.  Using the E<.Fl ypset> flag causes E<.Nm> to accept "
"YPBINDPROC_SETDOM requests from any host.  This option should only be used "
"for diagnostic purposes and only for limited periods since allowing "
"arbitrary users to reset the binding of an NIS client poses a severe "
"security risk."

"This option is used to ensure that the system binds only to one domain and "

"both NIS servers and NIS clients: it provides a way to restrict what "
"machines the system can bind to without the need for specifying the E<.Fl "

"holes.  The specified servers must have valid entries in the local E<.Pa "
