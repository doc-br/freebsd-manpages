"E<.Tn NIS> is an RPC-based service designed to allow a number of UNIX-based "
"machines to share a common set of configuration files.  Rather than "
"requiring a system administrator to update several copies of files such as "
"E<.Pa /etc/hosts>, E<.Pa /etc/passwd> and E<.Pa /etc/group>, which tend to "
"require frequent changes in most environments, E<.Tn NIS> allows groups of "
"computers to share one set of data which can be updated from a single "
"location."

"To make up for this, the E<.Fx> version of E<.Nm> handles the E<.Pa "

"When the server receives a request to access either of these two maps (or in "
"fact either of the E<.Pa shadow.byname> or E<.Pa shadow.byuid> maps), it "
"will check the TCP port from which the request originated and return an "
"error if the port number is greater than 1023.  Since only the superuser is "
"allowed to bind to TCP ports with values less than 1024, the server can use "
"this test to determine whether or not the access request came from a "
