"The E<.Nm> utility is the server which maintains the database used by the "

"The E<.Nm> utility operates as both a producer and consumer of status "
"information, unless the E<.Fl l> (listen mode) option is specified, in which "
"case it acts as a consumer only.  As a producer of information it "
"periodically queries the state of the system and constructs status messages "
"which are broadcasted or multicasted on a network.  As a consumer of "
"information, it listens for other E<.Nm> servers' status messages, "
"validating them, then recording them in a collection of files located in the "
"directory E<.Pa /var/rwho>."
