"The I<smrsh> program is intended as a replacement for I<sh> for use in the "
"``prog'' mailer in I<sendmail>(8)  configuration files.  It sharply limits "
"the commands that can be run using the ``|program'' syntax of I<sendmail> in "
"order to improve the over all security of your system.  Briefly, even if a "
"``bad guy'' can get sendmail to run a program without going through an alias "
"or forward file, I<smrsh> limits the set of programs that he or she can "
"execute."

"Briefly, I<smrsh> limits programs to be in a single directory, by default "
"/usr/libexec/sm.bin, allowing the system administrator to choose the set of "
"acceptable commands, and to the shell builtin commands ``exec'', ``exit'', "
"and ``echo''.  It also rejects any commands with the characters `\\`', "
"`E<lt>', `E<gt>', `;', `$', `(', `)', `\\er' (carriage return), or `\\en' "
"(newline)  on the command line to prevent ``end run'' attacks.  It allows "
"``||'' and ``&&'' to enable commands like: ``\"|exec /usr/local/bin/filter "
"|| exit 75\"''"

"System administrators should be conservative about populating the sm.bin "
"directory.  For example, a reasonable additions is I<vacation>(1), and the "
"like.  No matter how brow-beaten you may be, never include any shell or "
"shell-like program (such as I<perl>(1))  in the sm.bin directory.  Note that "
"this does not restrict the use of shell or perl scripts in the sm.bin "
"directory (using the ``#!'' syntax); it simply disallows execution of "
"arbitrary programs.  Also, including mail filtering programs such as "
"I<procmail>(1)  is a very bad idea.  I<procmail>(1)  allows users to run "
"arbitrary programs in their I<procmailrc>(5)."
